Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Reviewing after 2days of using Moto Edge 50pro (125W, 12gb RAM variant) -

Display - 10/10
Battery - 8/10
Camera - 8/10
Charging - 9/10

Pros -
Light weight, premiumness, flagship features

Cons-
Lots of heating issues while charging, booting, long time scrolling, Battery drains little quick as expected.

Charging speed(125W):
0-50% in 11min
0-80% in 20mins
0-100% in 29mins.

This phone is very good as per the specs provided. You can go for it. I hope heating issues will be resolved in future updates.

Everything depends on usage and P2P, the above views are my observations and may differ."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Just received my moto edge 50 pro yesterday. Look wise mobile is very good.
All accessories were in the box, although the back cover is kind of useless.
The 125W charger is charging mobile fast as advertised by moto.
As of now the performance looks great. Camera is great specially front camera. Colors are quite realistic.
I've given 4 star as of now, will update my review after few weeks of use."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Overall very decent product. Great work by Motorola team. Camera, display, design is very good. One can definitely go for buying it. Only observation is while charging with 125 watt charger,phone gets really heated up. Rest is fine. Ask me in case of any query."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Very nice camera
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Awesome display nd camera üíØ

Jst loved this phone ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Light weight, premium design and great camera"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"After 4 Days of Usage the Phone is awesome in this Price range with Superb Camera features
Need little improvement in camera especially in AI but Clarity is awesome feeling little lag when transferring photos also there is a frame drop feel while shooting vedio hope Motorola will rectify all small issues in next update
Anyway happy in this product"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Phone is temperature üå°Ô∏è high.
Using the phone first I noticed phone is heavy heating"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Super camera
Love you moto....,.................."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Awesome phone, Awesome quality picture, display...Just Buy it.."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Unique design. Moto has done a fabulous job.
Price really justifies it's specifications.

Unique Specifications-
1- . 125W fast charge.
2- IP68 rating.
3- Pantone validated camera and display.
4- 50W wireless charging.
5- 144hz display.
and many more.."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"The beautiful beast is here!

Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.

Beautiful:
1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand.
2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium.
3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.

Beast:
1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.

2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.

3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy.
4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear.
5. Network reception is great too!

I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.

Kudos to Team Moto!"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,Who are all looking for buy this mobile great decision you can buy best mobile ever this price segment very much impressed moto‚ù§Ô∏è
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,The phone is good but the Flipkart service is worse .
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time.
Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point.
Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Mind Blowing product.,. Such a terrific quality üíØ camera quality is awesome üòé"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"I have been using this mobile for the last 6 days and overall I am very Happy with this mobile.

1. Design: The design is very eye-catching and, feels very good and confident to hold in hand.

2. Camera: Camera set up is really awesome and best in this segment. I was impressed with the night photography. The best cameras.

3. Screen: Very impressive screen, eye comfort, and curved screen gives a very unique look to the phone.

4. Battery: Battery back is good for one full day by keeping the internet all the time on. I especially want to talk about a 125W charger which really charges mobile in less time.

I am really happy with this mobile and recommend buying it."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,3,"The phone gets warm sometimes. Especially after the 1st boot up it got very hot. Also it gets warm when installing any app.
Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't.
If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a
usage is not possible nowadays.
Given that Overheating and battery optimisation issues many reviewers are reporting, I hope they are fixable by software updates.
It's really annoying that none of the YT reviewers mentioned these issues."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,3,"Superb Design
Trendy Look

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Over all 10/9
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"I'm Giving Honest Review After Using it For more than 8Day .. let meat after 1 month..
I am Mentioning the Cons First..
1. The Battery is not Efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day . If u are a normal user and use it on only a4g/lte network then u may use it for whole working day
But if u are heavy user u have a charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times . It totally depends up to your uses and needs

Pros... But u will get 80/125 watts fqst charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only 40/20 min around .. actually they told 124 whattt charge it will take 19 min but it not true it take around 40 min

2.I noticed it's heating issues... bit don't think it's a Cons Caz I used I phone 12 for photography it is also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry it's a normal

But if u are heavy Using it at outside in the sun or any temperature area then try to avoid it

If u use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or at least in front af fan then there is no heating issue.....

Some youtuber said if u aren't use tempered glass for the very first day it gets scratches but totally false
cons..
1.battery is not up to the mark
2.turbo charging is good but it will heat your phone too much
3. No official motorola store to buy accessories
4. Camera take few minutes to enhance photo
5. They provided plastic screen guard (film)
Do not come with pre installed .

These phone gives u full of features and pro things ..
1. Display quality and brightness is awesome
2.camera is Next level it work with auto enhancement
3.Ram management is perfect . Still not found any choppy or lauggs
4.multitasking and gaming performance is good
5. Ip68 rating give u freedom to use worry free
6. It's comes with Dolby dual speakers sound Quality awesome
7. Most imp network quality it work 5g network Superficialy band is best
8. It's handy phone it will fits any size of hand
9. When it come in hand people noticed awesome feel
10.design is cool."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"the phone is quite amazing with IP68 , USB type C gen 3.1 though it comes with ufs 2.2 but it is well optimized for day to day use, Battery backup is also good but need some time to observe the usage pattern , kudos to the camera"

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"It has best camera setup. The 10mp telephoto is the same used in galaxy s24 and it takes impressive portraits.
The battery backup is quite decent.
UI is also very smooth but has no gallery app and file manager app."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,3,"Having issue with the double back tap option in the phone, it does not work most of the time. Apart from the had few issues with the performance, overall a decent phone. Anyone else having an issue with the double back tap (Quick launch) feature?"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Point-wise review for the Motorola Edge 50 Pro:

1. Stunning Display: The 6.7-inch P-OLED display offers vibrant colors and crisp details.
2. Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with up to 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and gaming.
3. Impressive Camera System: The 50MP main camera, along with ultrawide and telephoto lenses, captures stunning photos.
4. Battery and Charging: The 4500mAh battery with 125W wired charging provides all-day usage and quick
recharges.
5. Room for Improvement: Video recording stability and haptic feedback could have been better. I hope Motorola can fix the video recording part through a software update."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"I clicked a picture, it said it's processing but didn't show in my gallery and it vanished. The phone heats up in Vivid display mode."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Nice camara
Nice performance
Super fast charging"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"I usually don't write reviews but this phone deserves every praise there is to offer. Phone usually charges within 20-30 mins. And gives a whole day worth of screen time. The curved display is fantastic to touch and watch. Brightness is too good (I use it at 60%) and it's still too bright.
The processor is pretty good for gaming and daily usage. UI is pretty good and easy to use. Camera is awesome and preforms better than expectations. Especially the AI zoom... People were surprised when they saw the quality of images and videos this camera delivers. Lastly, the water resistance.... Today I went to WoW Waterpark and took the phone with me in all the rides... Suffice to say not a single issue with the phone and the videos are top notch. Anyone looking to buy a good mid range phone should definitely buy this without giving a second thought. Moto has really outdone itself with this model."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Better experience, üòâ
Happy with this product.üíú
Budget friendly.ü§ù."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Mobile is great for those who have moderate use. The camera is superb and the battery gives one day backup easily. It takes max 30 min to full charge. I love the design and screen resolution. It's the perfect mobile for daily use. No complaints at all.
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Excellent phone for this price range.

The camera is very good, and the OLED screen is just amazing. Charge goes from 5% to 80% in less than 15 minutes. The performance is on par for the segment, and there is absolutely no lag for day to day standard usage. The phone does get warm during some operations, but it is well within the limit.

The only negative is that the curved edge sometimes results in touch related issues. It happens only in some conditions of holding the phone in some specific way, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Battery:
I wake up in the morning charge my phone and come to the office, watch a movie on the train, use the office Wi-Fi all day, the phone is used enough, on the way home to watch a movie, come back home and use the Wi-Fi, my mobile data usage is very low. About 2-3 hours all day, but when I wake up the next day, the phone has above 40 percent charge, tell me if it's a good battery or a bad battery.
Camera:
I have been using S21FE5G mobile for 2 years so my Samsung was best except for portrait mode, but one more thing my Samsung camera app was slow, which this phone doesn't have, it is very fast.
Performance:
I was scared to buy after seeing negative reviews in many places that UFS 2.1 is very slow but after using it for 10 days I couldn't feel the slowness from any angle.
If there is any glitch, it is from the UI, it will be fixed when the software update comes.
Charger/Temperature:
I saw reviews in many places that there is overheat issue but when I set up the phone it got hot but I don't get overheat all day even from non AC and when I charge it with 125-watt charger the phone gets hot that's normal there shouldn't be so much controversy about it, if I Let me give you a small example. My Samsung phone charger was 25 watts. When my phone was charged below 15% to 100%, both the charger and the phone would be very hot, so I think it's normal.
Sound:
There are stereo speakers, the sound is strong but the quality could be better.
Display:
When I bought the phone I didn't even know if it had any display protection but Motorola chat support confirmed to me that it has Gorilla Glass 5 protection which I have saved a screenshot of."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Motorola edge 50 pro is the best smartphone for mid range user. Go fot it without hesitation.

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Haven't used the Motorola device for a long time. Using this for a couple of weeks now. Coming from Oneplus 7, I feel performance hasn't really dropped. Camera is definitely an upgrade and the only improvement area would be processing time for photos. Update can fix it. Display and design are top notch considering the price of the device. Haptics could have been better but remember what you are paying. Overall it's a flagship challenging device for sure. Good for daily use, charging speeds are insanely fast. I haven't observed heating issues at all. It just gets warm sometimes. Just hoping for on time software updates from Motorola at least after implementing the New UI.
Please note that UFS storage and RAM type for this phone are well
optimised and I haven't felt lag at all.
I have purchased the moonlight Pearl and it looks standout from the rest of the Mobiles.
One more suggestion for Motorola is to roll out some AI features that other brands are doing for better user experience.
I will update the review after long term use."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Very good camera phone
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"I am purchased this mobile on 14 may and received on 16 may. phone is good value for money . Camera awesome, battery 5000 mah is quite good for daily use but 4500 mah ok , charging time 40 minute plus 0 to 100 percent with 125 watt charger but over all phone good."

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"It's a nice product.
The camera is good. Bit sometimes lag. Performance is good.
Battery backup is not so good initially as high usage. Later when it becomes normal usage almost 1 day back up.
Charging is super fast within 25-30 mins with a
125w ch
arger. The charger is a big one, you need to buy an adapter, else it touches the switches.

User interface, need to adjust I was an apple user.

Curved display is a great experience.
Flipkart experience is somewhat bad. Due to delay in delivery Many a times.
Overall it's good purchase"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,The mobile is very good in this range...only problem is the battery as it is not that long enduring
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"The only thing I don't like is the phone getting heated up while charging and also if we play big games like pubg and COD.
If motorola do any upgrade on it it will be a class phone.
Rest all is way better"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Amazed with photo quality, Battery life should be better.
Gorilla glass 5 is Good but should provide victus protection in new phones"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Phone ok . Not a wow feeling . Battery department needs to be improved , I am using it in adaptive battery mode to use it longer for normal routine tasks . Phone screen is vulnerable to get broken better use a high quality case cover and screen guard"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"It's first day yet, camera is awesome, rest of the feature yet to establish, screen guard has been applied already, but no tempered glass in box, charging is good, but mobile feels heated little bit, have to see how it is on further usage.."

Cons only I can say is heating issue while charging."

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Review after 10 days of use.
1 - Camera 10/10
2 - Display 10/10
3 - Battery 09/10
4 - Charging 10/10
5 - Performance 10/10

With respect to other reviews, no heating issue was observed during usage and charging. For office use, I am getting a minimum 28 hours of battery backup. 125W charger takes 30min to change from 10-100%. The camera quality is really superb. The display is also good. The only problem which is observed is - screen guard and mobile cover provided with mobile are very poor quality and not for use. The camera takes some 6-8 seconds to process the picture. It may be solved in the next update. Worth for money. Thanks to Flipkart for quick and smooth service."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Less battery back up, but good for the average user. Performance is best. The camera is at its best with good detail capture.
Reviewing after 1 month of purchase."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,After using it for a week: worth buying it. We can't get these features for 32k in other brands. a small lag in some apps is there but I think this will be fixed in upcoming updates. The water test is not done yet. Will update you on that soon.
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Battery performance and battery charging speed is very fantastic . Camera is perfect but take 2 sec to store picture. Heating issue according to features is average. Processor is too good best performance to used multiple app. According to body dimensions some time is typical to carry phone with single hand . Body design is upper average. Overall not fully perfect but as per other mobile only this Mobil is perfect in this range . Overall rating 4.5/5

The battery capacity is very poor and the phone heats up quite easily. Considering the price and specs it's a decent buy but there are better options at this price point.
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,3,Battery is the worst. In normal usage it doesn't last for a day. Heating issues are the worst. In outdoor conditions even when you are not using the phone it gets heated up. If you activate the charge boost then it becomes an iron for your garments. Motorola should immediately issue updates to fix the heating issue. Utterly disappointed.

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,3,"Day1: Phone is perfect in ever aspects, but it gets a little bit hot on using it. Youtubers are saying that after some time this issue will not be seen. So I will edit this review after 20 days whether it is still getting hot or not. Rest everything is perfect."

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,The phone is good but it's not that great compared to what motorola claims... The camera is ok.. sometimes it gives darker pics compared to normal. Videos are good sometimes it adds color which is not natural. Also the battery is not good you have to carry a charger with you. Thought charging is fast. Also while charging the phone heats a lot even if you're not using it while charging. Overall it is a good phone but the price range is high compared to other phones compared to the performance. I hope the moto will fix these issues with updates

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"I am facing an issue with the display on my Moto Edge 50 Pro. According to the specifications on Motorola's official website, this model features a pOLED display. My understanding is that with a pOLED display, pixels should turn off completely when displaying black, providing true black levels and conserving power.

However, I have observed that when the display color mode is set to Natural or Radiant, the pixels do not turn off when displaying black images or black parts of the screen. The pixels only turn off correctly when the color mode is set to Vivid
Unfortunately, the Vivid setting boosts the colors excessively, which is not my preferred viewing mode.

Is anyone else facing the same issue?"

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Waste of money doesn't look premium or perform as a premium phone. Only the price is premium. I have used one plus 7, apple 12 and Vivo x90 pro, this phone doesn't even compete with the OnePlus 7 either in looks or in performance. I am very dissatisfied after purchasing this phone by seeing its performance. The touch is not so responsive, the display and phone hang very often. The camera performance is also not very impressive, lots of artificial coloring and pictures clicked on zoom are very pixelated. Pre-installed moto apps are annoying and useless. Phone doesn't come with stock Android."

Phone reboots unexpectedly.phone charges quickly but it drains quickly too with the normal usage. The camera is ok. Overall the phone gets hung and the application gets stuck so it is irritating and not usable. Performance is not at all expected. I have Vivo v15 pro which works better than this though it has 8/128. I will not recommend this to anyone.. Going to raise this with moto customer care and Hopefully moto gets fixed this."

1. Phone gets stuck in the middle if u use any of the apps. Not sure why it is happening and a minimal game like 8 ball pool also gets stuck in the middle. Biggest Blunder by moto. Getting irritated with this
2. Phone restarts suddenly
3. Overheats if u use ur phone for 1 to 2 hours continuously
4. Camera processing after a snap is really very slow

I would prefer to choose a different option rather than going with this irritating phone. Not worthy enough."

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"I'm using this phone last 15 days. Motorola edge 50 pro overall performance very good like if we talk about display, no doubt display quality very good , camera quality in portrait mode very excellent but I we talk about battery I'm disappointed with their battery. I faced battery draining littel bit fast and if we use turbo charger mode phone got hit . So overall phone is good but company need to update optimise in battery"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Pros:
- Very sleek design. Backside finish and touch and feel is good and non slipping.
- More real color and best contrast on display and touch screen response is fast and no lag
- Rear/back camera captures excellent true color images. Low light indoor photos are clear and no noise.
- Front/selfie camera gets sharp images of near distance objects but far distance objects gets blurred.
- My preference to Moto is for clean stock android OS. Opening and switching of apps is quick and no lag.

Scope of improvement (cons):
- Audio from mobile speakers is clear crisp but not loud. Spatial sound not impressive for songs/music, may be good for movies/video.
- Protection film given along with mobile is useful (different size, not fitting the mobile). Better to have solid screen protection (tempered glass) for screen.
Since new model, matching screen protectors are not available in market/web.
- Pressing icons/text on edge of curved display is not user friendly.
- Mobile cover given by Motorola doesnt protect dust getting inside (between cover and backside of the mobile)"

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,Do not buy this phone. The phone is heating up even with normal usage. Query was raised with Motorola about this and they responded stating that the phone is supposed to heat up while you stream or charge it. The battery is not adequate.
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Overall value for money product. Built-in Camera is awesome but needs some tweaking with software update to remove shutter lag. The provided back cover became loose in a couple of days. WAvideo calls are of mild quality.

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,Very Good phone in this price
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,3,"I will not recommend to any one...I bought this phone on the release day and here few flaws I found after using

1. Bad camera quality
2. No inbuilt AppLock and
3. No hide app options,
4. no dual/parallel app options ..which makes to download third-party apps with ads.
5. No inbuilt gallery or file manager..
6. When clicking pictures ,Saving time of a photo is long where if you move the phone or change your posture the photo gets blurred.
7. Apps keeps crashing and need to open atleast three to work.

Except the design I hate this phone and wouldn't recommend to buy to anyone."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"The main problem with the phone is the network, my earlier phone had better signal strength than this one. Missing lot of calls daily I have to switch both VoLTE and voice over wifi on to get okayish kind of signals but when I go out again signal gone, I have to turn aeroplane mode on and off then it catches signal.
No automatic power on/off feature. Pantone skin tone is nowhere evident for me in terms of color but picture quality is okay. Temper glass provided is of no use, it broke the next day.
The first day I had a problem with enabling face ID, customer support was a big headache, After a lot of struggle I got into a call and the representative told me to reset the phone, I had already moved all my data from my old phone to new and I had to redo, this resolved my issue.
No cloning for any app in this phone, now I am dependent on an app to clone the apps that I require.
The phone has a lot of software glitches while using.. suddenly the app gets crashed or non responsive, BTW I am using normal apps (no games)
Phones get over heated when I use the camera for more than 3-5 mins. Video recording 2 mins heated up the phone and I was afraid that I might burst in my pocket.
Charging is lightning fast, this is the only thing that I liked but battery draining is also quick but happy with charging speed.
Type C headphone port. I feel audio is good or loud only in closed environments.
Finally I don't recommend this phone to all."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Mobile is getting so much heat during the regular usage and even more during the charging.

And the Battery backup is not up to the mark. It hardly serves a day even though if I am not using constantly. Strangely this is without having or using any games as such.

And also the keyboard malfunctions sometimes while holding the mobile with two hands, with multiple fingers at the screen edges level.

And also I feel the network coverage capacity is also lesser side. Followed by even though I am the two 5G sims but majority of the time it works only on 4G networks in both the sims."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Display quality is very good The camera is also super one day battery life totally awesome üíØ product
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Light weight, easy to hold, good design and good display.
Decent battery, easily getting a day battery life, could have been more too but that is what you get with 4500 mah.
Faced minor glitches initially but working fine now.
Charger is of 125w which comes with a bigger size. Connecting it to any plug point is not possible as it overlaps with switch due to its size. Could have made it vertical than horizontal, the way we get it for OnePlus and other brands.
Camera is ok, not that great.
Quick charging is a good feature, charges my phone in 20 mins.
Back case provided is not of great quality, might need to add screen guard and strong back case for sure.
Speaker sound clarity could have been better tuned for clarity."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"The display is not showing the caller name or number...
And while typing on keyboard pad, letters are missing."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Best Flagship killer in the era of AI driven technologies. Moto has always the vision to work on the negative feedback to bounce back stronger. From the day of its rise to till date it have all reasons to be a best ever midrange Smartphone segment among the Android category. My only concern is about the battery back up which could be more better and more capacitive at least in the upper variant. Otherwise there is everything to say Hello to MotoüñêÔ∏èü§≥
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Superb üëå performance of 12 gb ram, 144 hz..display n last bt not d least looks n Camera..Superb"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Too much of heat,
Very slow performance,
Apps r not working properly,
Slow charging,taking minimum 40 mins for charge
Very disappointed"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"The edge display is too edged and it's inconvenient for reading and getting a headache. Also it tends to have a lot of ghost touches. Poor design. The camera is below average and the shutter speed is a bit slow as it takes a lot of time for processing and almost all the shots are blurry if your subject is moving. No burst shots option and you need to wait for the next photo. Heats up a lot for normal game play, camera usage. Definitely a no if you love to take photos of kids."
