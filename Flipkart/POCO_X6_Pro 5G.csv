POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Overall good phone
1- good sound quality 5/5
2- good display 5/5
3- decant camera 3/5 (not bad much better then average but don't expect like Samsung's and iPhones like)
4- good battery 5000mah 4/5 (quite good battery backup fast charging out of the box)
5- good processor mdt dimensity 8300 ultra 5/5 ( gaming beast lag free on every game like bgmi/ cod/ mlbb/ Genshin Impact / coc idk other game i play only this 5games daily).
[LPDDR 5x and ufsufs4 storage, game turbo mode, and Wild Boost 2.0, providing a smooth gaming experience with high graphics and memory management ]
Phone heat slightly while gaming not much but very ligh, camera could have been better thats all.
NO PHONE CAN BEAT POCO X6PRO at the price of under 30k, (HIGHLIGHT it gives 12gb512gb, LPDDR5x UFs4, 1.5k AMOLED display, duel stereo speakers with Dolby atoms). Everything is perfect"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,This is a true flagship killer
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Probably the 1st to Review, about the phone I have no words to describe as it says it is a flagship killer, Poco has offered their customers to experience a premium like phone as of Samsung S series. The performance and the display of the phone is just awesome. The only con of the phone is its camera, rest if anyone is looking for gaming and multitasking phones then there is no other option than buying a Poco X6 Pro."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Very strong performance phone. Good for medium usage. Gaming and Office work is more suitable. Camera is normal.
Virtual Proximity Sensor is a disaster. Keep in mind if you are serious about it."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,GooD Product
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Camera lover don't buy this phone.

Game lover must go with this...."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Ok but when I will charge the phone but full heated. overall I like it .gaming performance is awesome
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"After usage of 10 days my opinion towards this phone is that it truly justifies the budget. Performance is flawless. Network connectivity 5g very good. Auto switches between 4g to 5g. Display is good and 120hz works well. Media consumption will never disappoint you. HDR 10+ works fine. Yes, Curved display is missing. Sound output is loud and clear and performs better than realme phones. Gaming... No doubt this phone is built for gamers. Yes, Battery drains a little fast but 67W fast charger compensates the same and not a big issue. Camera at this price point is not the best but perfectly does the job. Got this phone around 20k after card discount and exchange bonus and found this was a good deal for me. Earlier impression of POCO is not good so i was confused about trusting the brand. But i think i took a good decision to purchase this phone. If you want to buy this phone, mark my word don't think twice and go for it."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Was bit sceptic about the camera before buying, but trust me guys it's good enough for daily social media life, on other hand it provides godly performance because of the processor. I can definitely call this mobile true flagship Killer after Poco f1... True successor üî•"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Reviewing for 512 GB storage variant,Great at multitasking and performance.... Below average at camera... But that's something you can compromise with... because except camera it's amazing in performance display battery department... At this price.....truly a successor to POCO F1"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Great job done by POCO. Again it's time to capture Indian market. Everything looks good like phone.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Pros
charging time is excellent
battery is good enough
display is the best you can get at this price range
performance is the best
5g works great
call quality, mic and speakers are good enough
fingerprint sensor is best imo

Cons
battery drains quite fast while doing heavy task like intensive gaming or watching 4k videos
camera is sub par
too much bloatware sigh
phone heats way more than expected in bgmi even at smooth 60 fps it gets really hot that i had to blow air out of my own mouth no kidding

Verdict
Overall it is a great device at this price range but dont expect it to be perfect"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"First of all i would like to say about performance, its very good and very smooth. Good for heavy usage. No worry to work for office.
Design and look is great and very handy phone. Display is fantastic. Battery need more optimize. Camera is also decent like normal but we have much more features of camera inside the app. Thanks to POCO and flipkart for providing this flagship smartphone. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Switching smartphone from a 10k one to 27k one is definitely a good Feeling üòÅüí´
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Actually it's a good performance device, people only defame POCO.
Value for money, I'm happy with the device.
I also have an iphone 15 pro which heats a lot at time of gaming.
Heat issues are a common factor when it comes to performance"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,This is the first review and I should say I just loved this device and it's performance üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"What a superb phone it is, fastest I have ever used, MTK D8300U is the ultimate predator in this price range. Ordered 12/512 GB.
Will update about firmware, camera performance later"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Great performance , great display and great for gaming. Camera is not the best but does good. But the 5000 mh battery doesn't feel like 5000. You need to charge the phone twice a day if u are a gamer."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Review after 54 days.
It is the best phone according to the price.
Camera 4/5 (price range)
Performance 4/5
Build quality 3/5
HyperOS 3/5
My unit does not have battery drain and heating issues."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Should have come with
IP 68 rating,
headphone jack support
or
at least 3.5mm jack to type c adapter and
sd card slot.
Camera needs a lot of improvement."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Best in the Market. So happy...
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Best gaming mobile

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Powerful gaming phone with awesome display Amazing sound quality and Nice Camera.
I'm happy with my new phone ‚ò∫"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"After using it for almost a month, i really like the phone, whether being it's snappy performance or lustrous display,rich audio. All are as said in the reviews,top notch,batter drain isn't worse but could have been batter, lasts 5 hrs sot, thanks to the incredible bundled fast charger doesn't make it seem like a big con. Yes all who purchased this phone have already convinced ourselves that we aren't gonna get flagship level camera but after buying this phone especially in this silky display,not able to capture the beautiful scenes as we enjoy is painstaking for sure. Below average is the camera. Ui side i liked it really,they have clicked the boxes for all the necessary customisations , always on display and the ability to check and reply on the always on display notifications needs to be implemented. And finding tempered glass which is edge to edge and using back cover is impossible,bid goodbye to either one. To summarise if u have a dslr or another flagship phone with nice cameras go for it .
Ll update in the future."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Camera:-pictures Getting blur,i think it's an ois sensor issue....but not at all times sometimes only

Battery:-if you are a bgmi player...you just have only 3.5 or 4 hours... without bgmi you will get 6 or 9 hours playtime

Display:-Simply awesome üíØü§ëü§ë

Design:-uniq design with leatherü§ëü§ë

Performance:- unleashed performance ü§Øü§Øü§Øi never seen these smoothness high graphics actually iam fan of snapdragon processor but unfortunately I get these poco x6 pro but guy's it worth to buy... trust me"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,Heating issue is there while normal use.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Very smooth, very faster‚ö°, camera above the avarage. It can handle any game. Hyper OS is almost 99% similar as MIUI, No difference. But it's lite. Sound quality extraordinary. Definitely Flag ship mobile"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Good device but hitting issue
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"This is honestly the best midrange phone in the market. The only shortcomings are in the camera department, but in my personal opinion it actually clicks good photos. Of course not on par with the flagships of iphone and samsung. But still relatively speaking for the price, it's good.
Performance wise it's godly. The best phone for mobile gaming. Speakers are great. Haptic feedback is good. Battery and charging good. It charges to full within 45 min or so for me.
Design is meh. It's not bad. The yellow actually looks good compared to the black and grey. Camera module design is a bit all over the place. It's not compact. But it can be overlooked for the performance.
I may update this review in the future as I have had this phone for only a couple of days."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Got it yesterday and writing my initial impressions
First of all let's address the elephant in the room processor and it's performance I would say just great phone is very smooth.
About display man it's beautiful really amazing and the speakers are loud and amazing.
Now let me give this line to mention the haptic it deserves the special mention for how good it is it's just great.
Now I would talk much about battery since it's just second day with this phone I'm testing this phone intensely so it's lasting about 4-6 hours sot during this I have installed apps and games although I would uninstall them later just to test thing I have installed them. But I have to say the charging is fast for me it's very fast it get charge from 20 to 90 in about 35-40 minutes.
Now about the camera although I haven't clicked much pics but I can say if you have good light photo will come out great but if not its not that good didn't recorded any video so I'm not sure about that. I would say it's good enough for me.

I have bought this for the processor and ufs 4.0, lpddr5x storage and Ram over other phone in this price range it lives up to my expectations.

My thought before deciding to get this phone was that while other phones has better camera and clean software but I'm sure I'm going to use it till it gets all it's updates and till then other phones will definitely slow down because future software will get even more demand. Because of the processor, storage and RAM that this has will definitely help in future.

Oh yeah about clean OS I removed all the unnecessary bloatware using Universal Android Debloater if you have access to pc give it a try."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Poco the brand which is known as flagship killer
And they proved once they're the best in the market
From fan of poco f1 till it gives best performance
Camera üì∏ needs to be improved and little bit battery drain is noticeable and this time they gives amoled which is best üî•"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Nice design, Performance best, Battry and camera decent but disply and software performance best in the price segment."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Don't think about the x3 series and the past experience. Go for x6 pro and seize it. It's a great value for money with decent camera
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Very good performance, camera is ok not very good, BGMI performance is fantastic"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"I'm using this phone for the last 1 week and the camera is pretty good, charging is real quick whereas the battery drains very fast... Gaming experience is of another level.. No heating issue at all and performance is really fantastic... I am just loving this phoneüòçüòç‚ù§

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,My new mobile battery drain issue
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"I dont know why other people gloryfying this phone. I have used a lot of redmi mobiles. Thats why i chose poco this time because its the rebranded version of redmi phones. I bought the 12/512 model.But after i start to use this phone my expectations were totally broked. These are the main issues i found in my model

1. Battery draining is more. Even though normal use. Not lasting even for a day
2. There is major stuttering and smudged visuals during video playback. This happens even on camera recorded videos. This problem is only when videos are playing.every app which plays video has same effect.
3. Even though its a 1.5k amoled. Some pictures are not viewing as its orginal clarity.

I dont know why this issues hapening. Poco should have resolve these problems through next os update. Optimization is very bad.Otherwise it will badly affect integrity and goodwill of your company."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"This is the best phone in this price segment.
pros
1. best chipset
2. best display
3. best battery backup

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Truly a flagship killer smartphone. Overall value for money after considering all its specifications at this price point.
1. Android 14 out of the box (+3 years Android update
2. 4nm Processor having high antutu score around 1.4 million
3. RAM extension (upto extra 8gb) from Internal Storage (UFS 4.0 type)
4. 1.5K 120 Hz Amoled Display
These are some good features of this phone"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Nice display and super fast prosessor and battery üîãüîãüîã backup nice camera us üåù
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"I've been using it since last two weeks,

the performance is exceptionally good, courtesy of the flagship d8300 ultra processor, it's a beast,

battery back up is good with moderate usage, gets some time to get accustomed to the hyperos and the UI,

Camera is also good enough, with some experimenting around with the camera, you can get some stunning shots,

Bought the phone for performance and performance it delivers till now, (will update rest sometime later after using more out of the device)"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,This is amazing phone at this price point. Buy it for performance not for camera.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"12gb ram and 512gb storage, you're crazy if you dont put in the extra 2k and get that version for your x6 pro.
Battery is sipped like a milkshake by the phone in performance mode with 120hertz refresh rate enabled.
If you game for 2hrs, battery goes down to 60% lol but its ok, the charger is 67w and will boost it back up in 20mins."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,Only battery draining fast problem but overall performance good...
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,I like phone performance but battery drain fast
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"If you are a camera lover please don't buy this mobile.
Day to day usage it is very good
First 2 days my battery drained very fast I don't understand the issue even phone is idel at that time also it has reduced 10 -15 %
I turned off the background sync and I reduced the screen refresh rate to normal then it is fine but not expect more than a day.
Display is very good
The processor is very good but os updates are required to more sustainable
Overall if you are looking for a good processor and display it is ok but if you need a good camera don't go for it."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"I have been using the 12/512gb varient and the phone is very light weight and feels good in hand, but the plastic back gives it a very cheap look and feel so I use the cover, moreover the battery life is decent maybe after another week of usage, I'll be able to determine the exact screen on time. The display is really good and It's visible even in Sunlight. The front camera is the best thing in this phone, this 16mp camera takes superb shots but the rear cam is average when compared with the phone's in this price range, the rear wide cam is good takes decent shots moreover cam dept can be updated through software updates and the the tone is a lil dull to my liking. The performance is amazing, every day task It can handle, gaming it can do, everything you throw at it, it'll handle with ease. (I have been using Poco X2, and when compared to that phone, The X2 has better rear cam). The phone is pretty fast and feels effortless while using!!!"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Battery is average.

The camera is good on day lights and also good at night too."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Over heating and battery also drain fast
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,All rounder phone
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,The phone is superb in performance. But the only cons in this phone is battery backup. If you are a hardcore gamer than never think that you can get more than 5hr of battery backup.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Battery üîã Drain automatically, why I don't know But Display and Performance top notch...
Pls push the Update and fix to Battery problem.
Overall Best Performance Phone in this Price range."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Good smartphone in this price range
Display and touch very good
Stereo speaker sound rating 3/5
Battery backup good
Charging speed very good
No heating issue in normal use
But Samsung One Ui is always winner"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"I purchased this phone for normal usage as for this price specifications were outstanding. Two things are disappointing about this phone, one is battery and the other is the heating. The battery drains fast even at idle and the phone heats for no reason. I am charging 2 times a day with normal usage. I have not played any games so far."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Improved camera
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,Performance is very good.. But thist phone have battery backup is not good and also heating issue
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"Mobile is fast and has good camera clarity for the price but a little bit of a heating problem I am facing.. Other than that it's good..
Thanks flipkart"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"Battery performance is very poor, it's draining too fast, overall good phone but only problem is battery draining"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"Big issue with battery
1.Battery getting heated for normal use only
2.Draining so fast

Camera-
Ok ok

Performance wise good
Pricing should be less"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"Battery drains very fast. Biggest negative is battery drain. Camera section needs to improve. After taking a picture, for few seconds the image freezing without processing"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,All goodüëç value for money
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Pros:
* Powerful processor
* Good display. Feels smooth and responsive.
* Takes about 40 mins for 0 to 100% charging
* 3 major updates and 4 years of security updates
* Very light
* Very good pricing for specs provided (only for gamers)

Cons
* Heating during gaming: I played fortnite 60fps and temp reached 45 C but when I removed back cover the temp dropped to 42 C which is still very high.
* Battery drains very quick

This will be the best phone for gamers in 25k-30k price range if Poco solves heating and battery drain problem. I hope Poco takes this seriously for the next update."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,I am happy üòä
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,awesome for gaming
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Camera is good, not excellent.
Battery performance is good, some heating issues while charging or gaming.
This is a gaming phone, so performance is superb.
If you are looking for a gaming phone then go for it."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Pros:
1) Nice crisp display, stereo loud Dolby Atmos speakers
2) Light weight (than it's earlier models)
3) It compute power is top notching Thanks to MediaTek Dimensity 8300 SOC, UFS 4.0, LPDDRX5 RAM
4) NFC

Cons:
1) No FM Radio,
2) No 3.5 MM jack port
3) Camera can be improved (both the sides)
4) Heating issue while Gaming/Benchmark run, fast battery draining"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"For regular usage it's only downside are it's camera,slight heat and just a little bit fast battery drain...then again our normal room temperature is 40 degrees nowadays so it's completely natural otherwise everything is perfect..too good performance wise."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Poco did poco Really awesome performance, best gaming phone"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Yes, I liked Poco X6 Pro...
Pros:
1. Excellent performance.
2. Best gaming in the range
3. Good Battery back up..barely goes below 50% in normal usage for 10-12 hours..
4. Fast Charging..
5. Minimal heating in normal games..

Cons:
1. Average Camera...but can be substituted by 3rd party apps..
2. Calling sensor not good...keeps on turning on the screen.."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Superb flagship killer phone comes with mid range price. Hyper OS handles all tasks very well. Display bezels ratio is 94.27% almost bezel less. 512 gb storage recommended. Grey colour gives prime look. Only issue is hard to find exact tempered glass and back cover.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"As i expected, everything is good, I'm happy with the phone.
Love the camera"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Worthy mobile at this budget range and storage will be a big plus!! Go for 512 GB variant
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"12/512gb, dimensity 8300 ultra awesome processor with nice battery life feature. Camera also good. Front display fingerprint works good.
Overall I got all great features within 26200 only.
Turbo fast charging very nice features after processor and yes Very important this is my 6th mobile and past 15 years I never played games in mobile. I also have oneplus 11 but here I will never compare it because along with features money also matters."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"The display is very good and the phone is very light. Thank you Poco company, you have given us a very good phone, I am deeply grateful."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"It's a beast. Truly it was. In every aspect. It simply cruises into every task, irrespective of how hard it is, and comes out with ease. It's cool all the time. It has silky soft touch display. With 3 more OS updates and 4 years of security updates to come, it's a steal to have this mobile, which surpasses any flagship, with it's robust performance. Hope the deficit in the performance of camera gets perfect, with the firmware updates to come."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Please use gcam and see the camera results ‚úåü§ó
Nor"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Rear and selfie Camera is beautiful in all aspects, capture natural colors. Stabilization is good while taking videos.
Display is top notch, performance is good no doubt about it.
Charging speed is awsum. It is very handy, lightweight. Battery backup is good too. Design is beautiful. I still use poco F1 but now I can say it's successor is finally dere. You can delete pre installed apps that's a new one. In display fingerprint is lighting quick and smooth, There are better customizatioms as well. It is a very close to a complete phone in under 30-35k range right now. One can go for it without hesitation.
Poco has improved there phones a lot."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Osm Display üòç
Performance is top notch
Camera average
Front camera actually good
Iam facing Battery üîãissue
Battery drains fast
Performance is first priority then go for it
I just buy this product for BGMI It's run very smoothly
Just loved it üòç"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"I will review it based on 5 criteria
1) Camera- above average, not very excellent but not bad also.
2)Battery- charging is very fast (takes about 50 mins to get fully charged) but similarly battery drain is also fast. If your use is extensive you might have to charge it 2 times per day.
3) Display- one of the best display ever, AMOLED and HDR display is one of the best i have ever seen.
4) Performance- performance is very fast due to very good processor.
Only issue is that the phone gets heated up very quickly even while doing basic task like video calling, so might need to keep it constantly under AC/fan.
5) Design- personally I like the design very much, especially the leather back.

Also it has xiomihyper OS and LPDDRX5 and UFS 4.0 which is really good.

So should you buy it? I think 12gb 512gb model is worth it if you are looking for performance and display ordiented phone and if you are getting a deal in less than 24k."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Nice
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Awesome phone, if you want performance just go for it. You will love it"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Over heating issues in 90fps gaming and battery draining.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Don't think just go for it if you need a performance centric phone.
Camera is also good.
Edit - battery optimisation is really bad. Battery is draining really fast. You can play Bgmi on 90fps, using 5G mobile data, 3 hour max on full charge."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Performance is satisfactory ,camera and battery is also very good. Best phone for normal use under 30k."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Pro- Excellent Display, punchi colours, smooth and fast. Performance Beast. Handles every task like butter.
Feels light in hand. The Cameras are not that bad that people thoughts. The main camera actually performs better than my earlier Redmi Note 10 pro phone.
Latest superfast Ram DDR5 and UFS 4 storage memory are take this phone in the Premium segment.

Cons- Phone feels heat when using camera and while playing games even for 10...15 minutes of use. These are winter days and if the heating is can be feeling then think what will happened in the upcoming summer.
Design is good but not that. The Phone is performance oriented but the Bulky, big round Back Cameras popups more though they not perform that best.
Buttons are very shaky and made of cheap plastic, It fees.

Final conclusion is best for Gaming and decent photography. But so delicate. If it gets drop from the shirt pocket hight, it will definitely crack the complete body. So be careful."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"1. Big issue with battery. Draining too fast - 3/5
2. Camera is below average but because of AI features come up - 2/5
3. Display is good - 3/5
4. Performance is also good - 4/5
5. Design - Attaching dust to fast around the Camera - 3/5.

Facing Frequently connection issue while gaming.

Facing issue with file manager. Not able to delete folders from the file manager.

I exchange the device two times but after going to Flipkart godown they reduce the price of device too much I don't know why. Even though my device condition is good, I also mentioned all things about the exchange device at the time of order."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,Silently Omitting a 3.5mm jack is not a good trend. The missing Micro SD card is another feature that will hurt in future.

Battery issues
Heating issues
Virtual proximity sensor issue
But there nothing like this , I have using this phone for more than 7 days. My last phone was x3 but now I have x6 pro.

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"I am writing this review after used of 2 months.
Mobile performance is super but battery is behaving as if it is 3000mah. Have to charge twice even for normal use/ no use. Really need battery optimisation"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,overall phone is gud but the worst part of is extreme level heating issue and high level of battry draining issue fix this in the future.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Mixed thoughts after buying this mobile.

Pros:
1.Performance: The phone delivers commendable performance for smooth usage.
2.Display Quality: The display is good, providing a satisfying visual experience.

Cons:
1.Charging Time: Despite the 67W charger, the device takes longer than expected to charge, which could be a concern for users seeking quick recharges.
2.Poor Camera Quality: The camera falls short in delivering satisfactory image quality.
3.Short Battery Life: The battery drains quickly, lasting only half a day on average usage.

4.Outdated Design: The phone's design feels old and might not appeal to those looking for a modern aesthetic."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"Camera is bad.
Low light and night times the camera performance is worst.
Good processor Performance.
Network strength is lesser.
Battery is Ok.
Display is not up to the 1.5k 120hz. Average display compared to other AMOLED mobiles."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,VERY NICE PERFORMANCE BUT THIS HAVE A MAIN ISSUE IS BATTERY DRIAN IF U R OK WITH IT THIS IS A KILLER üòà
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Best in this price segment
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Budget friendly performance beast..... selfie cam is good but rear cam is compromised...stereo surround sound...
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Phone is so light weight you can't even imagine, battery backup 5000mah is not upto the mark, quick charging is good, camera is ok not upto the mark photo get blurry when you zoom it."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"It's been 3 months since I got this device the price was 28k that time now it's 25499 for 12/512.

The cons are..
#bettry drained too quickly and #heating issue if using camera outside or while playing game like COD or BGMI

Pro's-
Performance is unbeatable in this price range
Portrait camera work's good it was not expected as it was a gaming phone"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Good Screen, feels great except Camera (Seriously). Lot to improve. My POCO F5 has a great camera with stabilization. Choose F6."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"This is a very good smartphone for its price. There are some short-comings here and there but overall it's very good. Shortcomings include that its camera is not really good, the battery drains very fast and the most annoying thing is that it heats up very fast even in normal usage. If we keep the shortcomings aside then it really is a brilliant smartphone. The company also tells us that we get 3 years of OS updates and 4 years of security updates, so problems regarding battery drain and overheating might get resolved in future updates. And i bought this phone in may 2024. There is one way to save it from battery drainage and overheating that is turn on battery saver, I found it after using it for a couple of days."

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"I don't know if it's just with my phone but if I keep someone on hold while taking another call, later I'm unable to reconnect to the first caller. I have observed many other glitches. I think this phone has good specs but is definitely not optimised. One reason that this phone can't be compared with the premium segment even with high end specs. My suggestion is not to buy this phone for now."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Do not purches a this phone. This phone having a over heating issue, battery not like 5000 mah, , even you night stand by battery drop is 1% every hour, if you charge 100% at night in the morning it is only 90 % . Net is also off.

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"All rounder phone but battery draining problem still now screen on time 5 - 6 hour, moderate to heavy use"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Didn't even install any app already too many bloatwares, and it started lagging while using chrome for the 1st time. Also build quality is so light and cheap that it feels like it can break or get damaged any moment. So much hyped about the display and processor, but it couldn't play 4K HDR video without frame drops. Also even 4K video seemd like pixelated. My 3 year old realme was way better than this trash. I used to keep open 70 tabs in chrome and plenty of apps in background but it never ever lagged in those 3 years."

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Excellent
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Great product Power pack for gaming.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"I have been using this mobile for 2 months. This is just an average mobile with a heating issue. Performance is also decent and battery discharge faster than expected. The UI is also decent with some noticeable bugs.

Overall if you are tight on budget do not buy this rather buy Iqoo (costly) or Nothing phone 2a (low price), for ultimate gaming save money for upcoming iPhone 16 to buy on emi."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"I have used poco m2 like 2 years more and I need a upgrade, so I just chose poco X6 Pro. Because it's performance is very good and no lags. This phone is very good except camera. Camera is just ok. But surprisingly the performance is excellent and I face when u play bgmi the frame rate will 90fps to 60fps reducing. And the hyperos is very good and they have many customisation on it. For me I am very satisfied with the poco phones."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Value for money
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"Battery dosent feel 5000mah and it overheats a lot due to stainless steel cooling chamber, the camera is good for normal audience unlike youtuber who say it's below average."

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Battery issues
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Very smooth to operate and refresh rate is one of the best in the phones available in India and can be compared to any good product with higher price and quality. I strongly recommend this as an alternative for Android phones with sky high prices because of brand charges for every basic need such as charger, case etc., blindly go for it without second taughtüòä‚ù§‚úåüéâ"

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,Superb... just go 4 it..üëç
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,Perfomance is good but what about sustained performance ? Is a pain in the brass to use this phone outdoors as it heats and drains quickly. If you stay at home or in Shimla this is a good performance centric phone for you. Do check my review on youtobe

The display and haptics are amazing.
The selfie camera is good, the back camera is average.
Performance is good but yes it sometimes drops to 55-60 fps in hot drops (event modes).
Design is average. I like classics more.
Stereo speakers are beast."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Product is awesome for the price. Great performance so far. Looks good. Only torture is the delivery time taken. They do not deliver on time, and had to escalate, cancel, reorder to get the product."

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"I'm here after 2 day of usage , thia phone is really flagship killer as a performance criteria it's a beast in this segment but the optimisation of ui is quite disappointed to me but the overall performance was good, here the camera section was good in day to day usage not for professional photography but it's belongs to a decent quality and the battery backup was quite not good i have to charge twice a day ... Thats why i rated 4.5/5"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Decent mobile
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Product is awesome but Flipkart's service was as usual,PATHETIC.

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,I wanted to buy M34 Samsung phone but didn't buy. And it was a mistake to buy poco x6 pro. I don't play games etc so don't much care about performance but I do care about battery and camera. And this phone seriously lack at both. If you want a device to play games then go for it.

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Absolutely perfect mobile

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Cool
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,All is well
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Product is good but battery is not good battery drain very fast
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Very good phone.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"The performance of the poco x6 pro is outstanding especially in gamming, camera is above average, battery backup in normal use it gives you one day backup if you heavy user it gives 7 to 8 hrs, sound quality is very good"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,The product is one of the best in performance as expected from POCO.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"This phone is a total game changer esp. if you are into high performance devices as an enthusiast. The features which it has are rare in even 70 K devices. A curved display and a slightly smaller front camera hole would have been better. But with such a latest processor and chipset, 12 GB RAM, UFS 4.0, OIS, Vegan leather back and very light weight profile, this is quite a delight.

Just to clarify, this smartphone is NOT for those who want the best camera, best display or the best gaming device.

It is a device with 13 Lacs plus Antutu benchmark score.
HyperOS is almost like MIUI.

The delivery experience (not the individual who came) was not upto the mark though.

Kudoz to Xiaomi and Poco for such a great piece of tech thought and a real world smart marvel."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Battery life improved after the last update. It offers excellent value for the money. Nothing sort of a flagship mobile. No regret.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Good phone, with decent battery life.
HyperOs have lots of glitches that need improvement.
The camera is the worst."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Excellent
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,plz solve heating problem otherwise to good üëç
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Just awesome...
In this segment, it gives every flagship technology... Just unbelievable...
The most important thing is that while using any app I'm not facing any ads issue.
But there are many other brands also who're giving advanced technology in this budget, and then we are facing ads issues in the inbuilt apps (File manager, maps, etc)"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Best. Mobile to buy
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"Initial Impression of Poco x6 Pro
1. Setting up phone is difficult. Have to search to check user agreement.
2. Battery draining very fast with normal use. Hope this stabilizes in few days
3. Phone getting hot with normal use
4. HyperOS is similar to MIUI
5. Cannot uninstall GoogleTv, Getapps, and Security app
6. Security app has inbuilt antivirus and it cannot be uninstalled. So, cannot use antivirus of my choice as two antivirus will slow down device
7. Reading news on Chrome 30 minutes drains battery 5%
8. Camera is good enough
9. Phone charges quickly with provided 67w charger
10. Device does not look premium like 27k cost
11. I feel back fingerprint reader is more practical than in-display fingerprint reader
12. Ads much lesser than older Poco phones
13. If you are not getting OTP, go to Settings; Mobile Networks ; SIM Card settings; turn off Make calls via WiFi

Edit: After 2 months usage, to reduce heating
1. Turn off notifications for most apps
2. Select Battery aver for most apps
3. Set refresh rate to 60 Hz
4. Search in Settings to Turn off animations
5. Chrome - Settings - Site Settings - Data Stored - Delete data
6. Enable dark mode
7. Use 4G LTE, instead of 5G
8. Under Location -Turn off Wifi and Bluetooth scanning

To increase battery backup, do this once or twice:
1. Use phone and allow battery to reach 0%
2. Switch off phone
3. Charge to 100%
4. Disconnect charger and then switch on phone

Update after 3 weeks usage:
14. Call quality is bad. Person on other side cannot hear me.
15. Latest system update did not fix any problems.
16. Buy X6 Pro only for gaming.
17. Normal users can buy X6."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Poco x6 Pro wonderful smartphone thank you Flipkart performance high level display high level
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Too many irritating bugs
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Best in price sector...
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Battery performance is not good as I expected.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Beautiful display with smooth performance although weak body. But worth it. No heating issue
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Best phone yellow 12ram and 512 internal storge

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,Don't buy this product eating problem not good
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,good perforamce
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Except camera Quality remaining is good at this price
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Good performance in this price segment..
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,The camera is good. But the battery drains fast and the display is okay and next about the performance then it is good but not for a long time gaming it heats up quickly and you can not play using the high settings of the game. If you would then it heats up quickly and heats with a very high temperature.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Everything is good except once google chrome crashed (due to bug)
I am wondering what will happen in future.
But yet it is very good for now"

Rest phone is good üëç"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Nice phone. Good for it. Don't study too much. If Ur budget comes to this range, it is the best phone."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Good Phone with 1.5k display 120Hz , Battery is good for normal tasks , but if you play games like bgmi which is a very heavy game , then max 3 to 4 hours back up then you connect the charger and play no problem.
Now if you play a normal game like asphalt 9 or stumble guys or cod,the phone gets warmer , if you play bgmi for 45 minutes the phone gets uncomfortable on top, the left hand suffers , having an AC or mini fan is a must for bgmi . I bought the phone for normal usage by seeing the specs at an incredible price and it is surely value for money at 2024 January .Some bugs are there in the phone."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Other than the battery life, great phone. Day to day performance is awesome. No lags. I haven't tried any games or photoshop or any of those heavy apps."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,OK
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,I have really a fantastic experience
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"It's very well in terms of performance. Camera is decent. Battery I found a bit underperforming when I see bettry usage. Most of the portion is taken by Google. But other than this it's too good.
Design is also quiet well. But it's difficult to use it by 1 hand only. You will have to use 2 hands while using it because it's size is big.

Hence 4 stars. I needed a device with exceptional performance in lowest budget. I found 1.
Also there's virtual RAM"
