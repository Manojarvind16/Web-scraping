Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Reviewing after 2days of using Moto Edge 50pro (125W, 12gb RAM variant) -

Display - 10/10
Battery - 8/10
Camera - 8/10
Charging - 9/10

Pros -
Light weight, premiumness, flagship features

Cons-
Lots of heating issues while charging, booting, long time scrolling, Battery drains little quick as expected.

Charging speed(125W):
0-50% in 11min
0-80% in 20mins
0-100% in 29mins.

This phone is very good as per the specs provided. You can go for it. I hope heating issues will be resolved in future updates.

Everything depends on usage and P2P, the above views are my observations and may differ."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Just received my moto edge 50 pro yesterday. Look wise mobile is very good.
All accessories were in the box, although the back cover is kind of useless.
The 125W charger is charging mobile fast as advertised by moto.
As of now the performance looks great. Camera is great specially front camera. Colors are quite realistic.
I've given 4 star as of now, will update my review after few weeks of use."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Overall very decent product. Great work by Motorola team. Camera, display, design is very good. One can definitely go for buying it. Only observation is while charging with 125 watt charger,phone gets really heated up. Rest is fine. Ask me in case of any query."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Very nice camera
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Awesome display nd camera üíØ

Jst loved this phone ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Light weight, premium design and great camera"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"After 4 Days of Usage the Phone is awesome in this Price range with Superb Camera features
Need little improvement in camera especially in AI but Clarity is awesome feeling little lag when transferring photos also there is a frame drop feel while shooting vedio hope Motorola will rectify all small issues in next update
Anyway happy in this product"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Phone is temperature üå°Ô∏è high.
Using the phone first I noticed phone is heavy heating"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Super camera
Love you moto....,.................."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Awesome phone, Awesome quality picture, display...Just Buy it.."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Unique design. Moto has done a fabulous job.
Price really justifies it's specifications.

Unique Specifications-
1- . 125W fast charge.
2- IP68 rating.
3- Pantone validated camera and display.
4- 50W wireless charging.
5- 144hz display.
and many more.."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"The beautiful beast is here!

Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.

Beautiful:
1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand.
2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium.
3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.

Beast:
1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.

2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.

3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy.
4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear.
5. Network reception is great too!

I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.

Kudos to Team Moto!"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,Who are all looking for buy this mobile great decision you can buy best mobile ever this price segment very much impressed moto‚ù§Ô∏è
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,The phone is good but the Flipkart service is worse .
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time.
Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point.
Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Mind Blowing product.,. Such a terrific quality üíØ camera quality is awesome üòé"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"I have been using this mobile for the last 6 days and overall I am very Happy with this mobile.

1. Design: The design is very eye-catching and, feels very good and confident to hold in hand.

2. Camera: Camera set up is really awesome and best in this segment. I was impressed with the night photography. The best cameras.

3. Screen: Very impressive screen, eye comfort, and curved screen gives a very unique look to the phone.

4. Battery: Battery back is good for one full day by keeping the internet all the time on. I especially want to talk about a 125W charger which really charges mobile in less time.

I am really happy with this mobile and recommend buying it."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,3,"The phone gets warm sometimes. Especially after the 1st boot up it got very hot. Also it gets warm when installing any app.
Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't.
If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a
usage is not possible nowadays.
Given that Overheating and battery optimisation issues many reviewers are reporting, I hope they are fixable by software updates.
It's really annoying that none of the YT reviewers mentioned these issues."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,3,"Superb Design
Trendy Look

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Over all 10/9
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"I'm Giving Honest Review After Using it For more than 8Day .. let meat after 1 month..
I am Mentioning the Cons First..
1. The Battery is not Efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day . If u are a normal user and use it on only a4g/lte network then u may use it for whole working day
But if u are heavy user u have a charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times . It totally depends up to your uses and needs

Pros... But u will get 80/125 watts fqst charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only 40/20 min around .. actually they told 124 whattt charge it will take 19 min but it not true it take around 40 min

2.I noticed it's heating issues... bit don't think it's a Cons Caz I used I phone 12 for photography it is also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry it's a normal

But if u are heavy Using it at outside in the sun or any temperature area then try to avoid it

If u use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or at least in front af fan then there is no heating issue.....

Some youtuber said if u aren't use tempered glass for the very first day it gets scratches but totally false
cons..
1.battery is not up to the mark
2.turbo charging is good but it will heat your phone too much
3. No official motorola store to buy accessories
4. Camera take few minutes to enhance photo
5. They provided plastic screen guard (film)
Do not come with pre installed .

These phone gives u full of features and pro things ..
1. Display quality and brightness is awesome
2.camera is Next level it work with auto enhancement
3.Ram management is perfect . Still not found any choppy or lauggs
4.multitasking and gaming performance is good
5. Ip68 rating give u freedom to use worry free
6. It's comes with Dolby dual speakers sound Quality awesome
7. Most imp network quality it work 5g network Superficialy band is best
8. It's handy phone it will fits any size of hand
9. When it come in hand people noticed awesome feel
10.design is cool."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"the phone is quite amazing with IP68 , USB type C gen 3.1 though it comes with ufs 2.2 but it is well optimized for day to day use, Battery backup is also good but need some time to observe the usage pattern , kudos to the camera"

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"It has best camera setup. The 10mp telephoto is the same used in galaxy s24 and it takes impressive portraits.
The battery backup is quite decent.
UI is also very smooth but has no gallery app and file manager app."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,3,"Having issue with the double back tap option in the phone, it does not work most of the time. Apart from the had few issues with the performance, overall a decent phone. Anyone else having an issue with the double back tap (Quick launch) feature?"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Point-wise review for the Motorola Edge 50 Pro:

1. Stunning Display: The 6.7-inch P-OLED display offers vibrant colors and crisp details.
2. Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with up to 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and gaming.
3. Impressive Camera System: The 50MP main camera, along with ultrawide and telephoto lenses, captures stunning photos.
4. Battery and Charging: The 4500mAh battery with 125W wired charging provides all-day usage and quick
recharges.
5. Room for Improvement: Video recording stability and haptic feedback could have been better. I hope Motorola can fix the video recording part through a software update."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"I clicked a picture, it said it's processing but didn't show in my gallery and it vanished. The phone heats up in Vivid display mode."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Nice camara
Nice performance
Super fast charging"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"I usually don't write reviews but this phone deserves every praise there is to offer. Phone usually charges within 20-30 mins. And gives a whole day worth of screen time. The curved display is fantastic to touch and watch. Brightness is too good (I use it at 60%) and it's still too bright.
The processor is pretty good for gaming and daily usage. UI is pretty good and easy to use. Camera is awesome and preforms better than expectations. Especially the AI zoom... People were surprised when they saw the quality of images and videos this camera delivers. Lastly, the water resistance.... Today I went to WoW Waterpark and took the phone with me in all the rides... Suffice to say not a single issue with the phone and the videos are top notch. Anyone looking to buy a good mid range phone should definitely buy this without giving a second thought. Moto has really outdone itself with this model."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Better experience, üòâ
Happy with this product.üíú
Budget friendly.ü§ù."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Mobile is great for those who have moderate use. The camera is superb and the battery gives one day backup easily. It takes max 30 min to full charge. I love the design and screen resolution. It's the perfect mobile for daily use. No complaints at all.
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Excellent phone for this price range.

The camera is very good, and the OLED screen is just amazing. Charge goes from 5% to 80% in less than 15 minutes. The performance is on par for the segment, and there is absolutely no lag for day to day standard usage. The phone does get warm during some operations, but it is well within the limit.

The only negative is that the curved edge sometimes results in touch related issues. It happens only in some conditions of holding the phone in some specific way, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Battery:
I wake up in the morning charge my phone and come to the office, watch a movie on the train, use the office Wi-Fi all day, the phone is used enough, on the way home to watch a movie, come back home and use the Wi-Fi, my mobile data usage is very low. About 2-3 hours all day, but when I wake up the next day, the phone has above 40 percent charge, tell me if it's a good battery or a bad battery.
Camera:
I have been using S21FE5G mobile for 2 years so my Samsung was best except for portrait mode, but one more thing my Samsung camera app was slow, which this phone doesn't have, it is very fast.
Performance:
I was scared to buy after seeing negative reviews in many places that UFS 2.1 is very slow but after using it for 10 days I couldn't feel the slowness from any angle.
If there is any glitch, it is from the UI, it will be fixed when the software update comes.
Charger/Temperature:
I saw reviews in many places that there is overheat issue but when I set up the phone it got hot but I don't get overheat all day even from non AC and when I charge it with 125-watt charger the phone gets hot that's normal there shouldn't be so much controversy about it, if I Let me give you a small example. My Samsung phone charger was 25 watts. When my phone was charged below 15% to 100%, both the charger and the phone would be very hot, so I think it's normal.
Sound:
There are stereo speakers, the sound is strong but the quality could be better.
Display:
When I bought the phone I didn't even know if it had any display protection but Motorola chat support confirmed to me that it has Gorilla Glass 5 protection which I have saved a screenshot of."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Motorola edge 50 pro is the best smartphone for mid range user. Go fot it without hesitation.

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Haven't used the Motorola device for a long time. Using this for a couple of weeks now. Coming from Oneplus 7, I feel performance hasn't really dropped. Camera is definitely an upgrade and the only improvement area would be processing time for photos. Update can fix it. Display and design are top notch considering the price of the device. Haptics could have been better but remember what you are paying. Overall it's a flagship challenging device for sure. Good for daily use, charging speeds are insanely fast. I haven't observed heating issues at all. It just gets warm sometimes. Just hoping for on time software updates from Motorola at least after implementing the New UI.
Please note that UFS storage and RAM type for this phone are well
optimised and I haven't felt lag at all.
I have purchased the moonlight Pearl and it looks standout from the rest of the Mobiles.
One more suggestion for Motorola is to roll out some AI features that other brands are doing for better user experience.
I will update the review after long term use."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Very good camera phone
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"I am purchased this mobile on 14 may and received on 16 may. phone is good value for money . Camera awesome, battery 5000 mah is quite good for daily use but 4500 mah ok , charging time 40 minute plus 0 to 100 percent with 125 watt charger but over all phone good."

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"It's a nice product.
The camera is good. Bit sometimes lag. Performance is good.
Battery backup is not so good initially as high usage. Later when it becomes normal usage almost 1 day back up.
Charging is super fast within 25-30 mins with a
125w ch
arger. The charger is a big one, you need to buy an adapter, else it touches the switches.

User interface, need to adjust I was an apple user.

Curved display is a great experience.
Flipkart experience is somewhat bad. Due to delay in delivery Many a times.
Overall it's good purchase"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,The mobile is very good in this range...only problem is the battery as it is not that long enduring
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"The only thing I don't like is the phone getting heated up while charging and also if we play big games like pubg and COD.
If motorola do any upgrade on it it will be a class phone.
Rest all is way better"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Amazed with photo quality, Battery life should be better.
Gorilla glass 5 is Good but should provide victus protection in new phones"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Phone ok . Not a wow feeling . Battery department needs to be improved , I am using it in adaptive battery mode to use it longer for normal routine tasks . Phone screen is vulnerable to get broken better use a high quality case cover and screen guard"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"It's first day yet, camera is awesome, rest of the feature yet to establish, screen guard has been applied already, but no tempered glass in box, charging is good, but mobile feels heated little bit, have to see how it is on further usage.."

Cons only I can say is heating issue while charging."

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Review after 10 days of use.
1 - Camera 10/10
2 - Display 10/10
3 - Battery 09/10
4 - Charging 10/10
5 - Performance 10/10

With respect to other reviews, no heating issue was observed during usage and charging. For office use, I am getting a minimum 28 hours of battery backup. 125W charger takes 30min to change from 10-100%. The camera quality is really superb. The display is also good. The only problem which is observed is - screen guard and mobile cover provided with mobile are very poor quality and not for use. The camera takes some 6-8 seconds to process the picture. It may be solved in the next update. Worth for money. Thanks to Flipkart for quick and smooth service."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Less battery back up, but good for the average user. Performance is best. The camera is at its best with good detail capture.
Reviewing after 1 month of purchase."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,After using it for a week: worth buying it. We can't get these features for 32k in other brands. a small lag in some apps is there but I think this will be fixed in upcoming updates. The water test is not done yet. Will update you on that soon.
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Battery performance and battery charging speed is very fantastic . Camera is perfect but take 2 sec to store picture. Heating issue according to features is average. Processor is too good best performance to used multiple app. According to body dimensions some time is typical to carry phone with single hand . Body design is upper average. Overall not fully perfect but as per other mobile only this Mobil is perfect in this range . Overall rating 4.5/5

The battery capacity is very poor and the phone heats up quite easily. Considering the price and specs it's a decent buy but there are better options at this price point.
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,3,Battery is the worst. In normal usage it doesn't last for a day. Heating issues are the worst. In outdoor conditions even when you are not using the phone it gets heated up. If you activate the charge boost then it becomes an iron for your garments. Motorola should immediately issue updates to fix the heating issue. Utterly disappointed.

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,3,"Day1: Phone is perfect in ever aspects, but it gets a little bit hot on using it. Youtubers are saying that after some time this issue will not be seen. So I will edit this review after 20 days whether it is still getting hot or not. Rest everything is perfect."

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,The phone is good but it's not that great compared to what motorola claims... The camera is ok.. sometimes it gives darker pics compared to normal. Videos are good sometimes it adds color which is not natural. Also the battery is not good you have to carry a charger with you. Thought charging is fast. Also while charging the phone heats a lot even if you're not using it while charging. Overall it is a good phone but the price range is high compared to other phones compared to the performance. I hope the moto will fix these issues with updates

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"I am facing an issue with the display on my Moto Edge 50 Pro. According to the specifications on Motorola's official website, this model features a pOLED display. My understanding is that with a pOLED display, pixels should turn off completely when displaying black, providing true black levels and conserving power.

However, I have observed that when the display color mode is set to Natural or Radiant, the pixels do not turn off when displaying black images or black parts of the screen. The pixels only turn off correctly when the color mode is set to Vivid
Unfortunately, the Vivid setting boosts the colors excessively, which is not my preferred viewing mode.

Is anyone else facing the same issue?"

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Waste of money doesn't look premium or perform as a premium phone. Only the price is premium. I have used one plus 7, apple 12 and Vivo x90 pro, this phone doesn't even compete with the OnePlus 7 either in looks or in performance. I am very dissatisfied after purchasing this phone by seeing its performance. The touch is not so responsive, the display and phone hang very often. The camera performance is also not very impressive, lots of artificial coloring and pictures clicked on zoom are very pixelated. Pre-installed moto apps are annoying and useless. Phone doesn't come with stock Android."

Phone reboots unexpectedly.phone charges quickly but it drains quickly too with the normal usage. The camera is ok. Overall the phone gets hung and the application gets stuck so it is irritating and not usable. Performance is not at all expected. I have Vivo v15 pro which works better than this though it has 8/128. I will not recommend this to anyone.. Going to raise this with moto customer care and Hopefully moto gets fixed this."

1. Phone gets stuck in the middle if u use any of the apps. Not sure why it is happening and a minimal game like 8 ball pool also gets stuck in the middle. Biggest Blunder by moto. Getting irritated with this
2. Phone restarts suddenly
3. Overheats if u use ur phone for 1 to 2 hours continuously
4. Camera processing after a snap is really very slow

I would prefer to choose a different option rather than going with this irritating phone. Not worthy enough."

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"I'm using this phone last 15 days. Motorola edge 50 pro overall performance very good like if we talk about display, no doubt display quality very good , camera quality in portrait mode very excellent but I we talk about battery I'm disappointed with their battery. I faced battery draining littel bit fast and if we use turbo charger mode phone got hit . So overall phone is good but company need to update optimise in battery"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Pros:
- Very sleek design. Backside finish and touch and feel is good and non slipping.
- More real color and best contrast on display and touch screen response is fast and no lag
- Rear/back camera captures excellent true color images. Low light indoor photos are clear and no noise.
- Front/selfie camera gets sharp images of near distance objects but far distance objects gets blurred.
- My preference to Moto is for clean stock android OS. Opening and switching of apps is quick and no lag.

Scope of improvement (cons):
- Audio from mobile speakers is clear crisp but not loud. Spatial sound not impressive for songs/music, may be good for movies/video.
- Protection film given along with mobile is useful (different size, not fitting the mobile). Better to have solid screen protection (tempered glass) for screen.
Since new model, matching screen protectors are not available in market/web.
- Pressing icons/text on edge of curved display is not user friendly.
- Mobile cover given by Motorola doesnt protect dust getting inside (between cover and backside of the mobile)"

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,Do not buy this phone. The phone is heating up even with normal usage. Query was raised with Motorola about this and they responded stating that the phone is supposed to heat up while you stream or charge it. The battery is not adequate.
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Overall value for money product. Built-in Camera is awesome but needs some tweaking with software update to remove shutter lag. The provided back cover became loose in a couple of days. WAvideo calls are of mild quality.

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,Very Good phone in this price
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,3,"I will not recommend to any one...I bought this phone on the release day and here few flaws I found after using

1. Bad camera quality
2. No inbuilt AppLock and
3. No hide app options,
4. no dual/parallel app options ..which makes to download third-party apps with ads.
5. No inbuilt gallery or file manager..
6. When clicking pictures ,Saving time of a photo is long where if you move the phone or change your posture the photo gets blurred.
7. Apps keeps crashing and need to open atleast three to work.

Except the design I hate this phone and wouldn't recommend to buy to anyone."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"The main problem with the phone is the network, my earlier phone had better signal strength than this one. Missing lot of calls daily I have to switch both VoLTE and voice over wifi on to get okayish kind of signals but when I go out again signal gone, I have to turn aeroplane mode on and off then it catches signal.
No automatic power on/off feature. Pantone skin tone is nowhere evident for me in terms of color but picture quality is okay. Temper glass provided is of no use, it broke the next day.
The first day I had a problem with enabling face ID, customer support was a big headache, After a lot of struggle I got into a call and the representative told me to reset the phone, I had already moved all my data from my old phone to new and I had to redo, this resolved my issue.
No cloning for any app in this phone, now I am dependent on an app to clone the apps that I require.
The phone has a lot of software glitches while using.. suddenly the app gets crashed or non responsive, BTW I am using normal apps (no games)
Phones get over heated when I use the camera for more than 3-5 mins. Video recording 2 mins heated up the phone and I was afraid that I might burst in my pocket.
Charging is lightning fast, this is the only thing that I liked but battery draining is also quick but happy with charging speed.
Type C headphone port. I feel audio is good or loud only in closed environments.
Finally I don't recommend this phone to all."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,4,"Mobile is getting so much heat during the regular usage and even more during the charging.

And the Battery backup is not up to the mark. It hardly serves a day even though if I am not using constantly. Strangely this is without having or using any games as such.

And also the keyboard malfunctions sometimes while holding the mobile with two hands, with multiple fingers at the screen edges level.

And also I feel the network coverage capacity is also lesser side. Followed by even though I am the two 5G sims but majority of the time it works only on 4G networks in both the sims."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Display quality is very good The camera is also super one day battery life totally awesome üíØ product
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Light weight, easy to hold, good design and good display.
Decent battery, easily getting a day battery life, could have been more too but that is what you get with 4500 mah.
Faced minor glitches initially but working fine now.
Charger is of 125w which comes with a bigger size. Connecting it to any plug point is not possible as it overlaps with switch due to its size. Could have made it vertical than horizontal, the way we get it for OnePlus and other brands.
Camera is ok, not that great.
Quick charging is a good feature, charges my phone in 20 mins.
Back case provided is not of great quality, might need to add screen guard and strong back case for sure.
Speaker sound clarity could have been better tuned for clarity."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"The display is not showing the caller name or number...
And while typing on keyboard pad, letters are missing."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,Best Flagship killer in the era of AI driven technologies. Moto has always the vision to work on the negative feedback to bounce back stronger. From the day of its rise to till date it have all reasons to be a best ever midrange Smartphone segment among the Android category. My only concern is about the battery back up which could be more better and more capacitive at least in the upper variant. Otherwise there is everything to say Hello to MotoüñêÔ∏èü§≥
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Superb üëå performance of 12 gb ram, 144 hz..display n last bt not d least looks n Camera..Superb"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"Too much of heat,
Very slow performance,
Apps r not working properly,
Slow charging,taking minimum 40 mins for charge
Very disappointed"
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,5,"The edge display is too edged and it's inconvenient for reading and getting a headache. Also it tends to have a lot of ghost touches. Poor design. The camera is below average and the shutter speed is a bit slow as it takes a lot of time for processing and almost all the shots are blurry if your subject is moving. No burst shots option and you need to wait for the next photo. Heats up a lot for normal game play, camera usage. Definitely a no if you love to take photos of kids."

Colours in the display is not good, to much light
No gallery app provided. Only Google photo aap we can use which is not good.
No dual app option given.
Can not install themes only 4 inbuilt theme are there to use which is not good.
Display size and font size adjustment is not good. Really bad function.

OnePlus 11R 5G,4,I'm writing this review after 1 month of experience let's get to the point if you are a hardcore gamer stay away from this device yeah 8+ gen 1 not giving it peek performance in this device.. and the camera it's good details is very very good... The display is just awesome you can watch Netflix in HDR 10+.. and the battery you can see in pic BTW I didn't charge 100% battery it's from 86%
OnePlus 11R 5G,5,"Camera Superb, Display Is Amazing. Overall A Great Phone On This Budget Segment."
OnePlus 11R 5G,4,Beautiful selfie and rear
OnePlus 11R 5G,4,"1.I didn't expect the display was really awesome with 1.5k resolution.
2.Main 50MP Camera is performing great.others are 8+2 performs decent.
3.Battery is very good it comes with 5000mah and 100w fast charging really superb.It gives 7 to 8 hrs screen on time.
4.Proccessor is really cool.It runs any application easily without any lags.
5.Design is one of the major highlight of this phone.Really Excellent design."
OnePlus 11R 5G,5,"Fully satisfied with the product. It is a true flagship killer phone. Main Camera is very good but other two cameras are average. Photos in daylight as well as in night are great. I would rate camera 4 out of 5.

Performance is top notch with snapdragon 8 gen 1 processor. I would rate processor 4.5 out of 5.

Battery backup is great. It lasts almost a day with moderate usage. I would rate battery 4.7 out of 5

Charging is awesome. 100 watt charger fully charges the phone in around half an hour. I would rate charging speed 5 out of 5.

Built quality is great. But back panel is slippery so back cover is essential.

Display of the phone is very bright and crisp. I would rate it 5 out of 5.

I would suggest everyone to buy this smartphone if one would compromise somewhat with secondary cameras."

OnePlus 11R 5G,3,"Hardware specs are fantastic . Great display ,
fast performance ,
battery holds up pretty well
Good camera
The reason for a 3 star rating is the software .
Coming from a Samsung phone this UI does not feel premium tbh . I have a few issues with it
- the notifications panel is a big inconvenience . You cannot drag to collapse or expand . You have to click the tiny down arrow on the corner of the notification. Google news does display properly on the notification panel .
Swiping right clears the notification but sweeping left doesn't . If swiping left you have to do it twice to clear
- 15s skip forward on spotify doesn't skip forward when on lockscreen . It rewinds 15s
- colour picker from wallpaper doesn't seem to work properly . It does not matter which points you choose only one colour gets applied everywhere

Just mentioning some issues i have been facing . Stuff you cannot find on a spec sheet . Hope they fix all these in the upcoming updates"

OnePlus 11R 5G,4,"Updated to Android 14. Overall good phone, performance, built quality, display, oxygen os, call quality, network reception, sound, battery backup, charging speed, all are good, except the camera department. Front camera has a face beauty mode, which does not work properly. It shows smooth skin while capturing but then makes the skin look rough again after capturing, so it just spoils the joy of taking selfies. Retouch/beautify during video call option is disabled in this phone. So, without these basic and essential camera features I don't recommend anybody to buy this phone."

OnePlus 11R 5G,4,"I was One plus 7 pro user.
Display quality is not that satisfactory because it have 451 ppi only.
Primary 50 mp camera is good but another 2 (wild angle and macro) is only 8 and 2.
Night vision camera is good again only 50mp camera works satisfactory rest 2 cameras are useless I will say.
The processor and speed is mind-blowing.
Selfie camera is average.
Battery charging speed is incredible It charges 100% only in 20-25 minutes.
That work around 7 8 hours heavy performance and normal usage you can use upto entire day.
Game is experience is good.
Phone built quality and comfort is good.
If you are looking under 50k this is a good phone(16/256gb)
Feature (display,camera, processor) wise One plus 11 is better than one plus 11r but obviously you have to pay more extra bucks.
I will rate

They are not even addressing this problem... You'll be irritated all day long because of this.. the switch between 5g and 4g is really unstable...

1- good sound quality 5/5
2- good display 5/5
3- decant camera 3/5 (not bad much better then average but don't expect like Samsung's and iPhones like)
4- good battery 5000mah 4/5 (quite good battery backup fast charging out of the box)
5- good processor mdt dimensity 8300 ultra 5/5 ( gaming beast lag free on every game like bgmi/ cod/ mlbb/ Genshin Impact / coc idk other game i play only this 5games daily).
[LPDDR 5x and ufsufs4 storage, game turbo mode, and Wild Boost 2.0, providing a smooth gaming experience with high graphics and memory management ]
Phone heat slightly while gaming not much but very ligh, camera could have been better thats all.
NO PHONE CAN BEAT POCO X6PRO at the price of under 30k, (HIGHLIGHT it gives 12gb512gb, LPDDR5x UFs4, 1.5k AMOLED display, duel stereo speakers with Dolby atoms). Everything is perfect"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,This is a true flagship killer
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Probably the 1st to Review, about the phone I have no words to describe as it says it is a flagship killer, Poco has offered their customers to experience a premium like phone as of Samsung S series. The performance and the display of the phone is just awesome. The only con of the phone is its camera, rest if anyone is looking for gaming and multitasking phones then there is no other option than buying a Poco X6 Pro."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Very strong performance phone. Good for medium usage. Gaming and Office work is more suitable. Camera is normal.
Virtual Proximity Sensor is a disaster. Keep in mind if you are serious about it."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,GooD Product
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Camera lover don't buy this phone.

Game lover must go with this...."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Ok but when I will charge the phone but full heated. overall I like it .gaming performance is awesome
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"After usage of 10 days my opinion towards this phone is that it truly justifies the budget. Performance is flawless. Network connectivity 5g very good. Auto switches between 4g to 5g. Display is good and 120hz works well. Media consumption will never disappoint you. HDR 10+ works fine. Yes, Curved display is missing. Sound output is loud and clear and performs better than realme phones. Gaming... No doubt this phone is built for gamers. Yes, Battery drains a little fast but 67W fast charger compensates the same and not a big issue. Camera at this price point is not the best but perfectly does the job. Got this phone around 20k after card discount and exchange bonus and found this was a good deal for me. Earlier impression of POCO is not good so i was confused about trusting the brand. But i think i took a good decision to purchase this phone. If you want to buy this phone, mark my word don't think twice and go for it."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Was bit sceptic about the camera before buying, but trust me guys it's good enough for daily social media life, on other hand it provides godly performance because of the processor. I can definitely call this mobile true flagship Killer after Poco f1... True successor üî•"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Reviewing for 512 GB storage variant,Great at multitasking and performance.... Below average at camera... But that's something you can compromise with... because except camera it's amazing in performance display battery department... At this price.....truly a successor to POCO F1"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Great job done by POCO. Again it's time to capture Indian market. Everything looks good like phone.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Pros
charging time is excellent
battery is good enough
display is the best you can get at this price range
performance is the best
5g works great
call quality, mic and speakers are good enough
fingerprint sensor is best imo

Cons
battery drains quite fast while doing heavy task like intensive gaming or watching 4k videos
camera is sub par
too much bloatware sigh
phone heats way more than expected in bgmi even at smooth 60 fps it gets really hot that i had to blow air out of my own mouth no kidding

Verdict
Overall it is a great device at this price range but dont expect it to be perfect"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"First of all i would like to say about performance, its very good and very smooth. Good for heavy usage. No worry to work for office.
Design and look is great and very handy phone. Display is fantastic. Battery need more optimize. Camera is also decent like normal but we have much more features of camera inside the app. Thanks to POCO and flipkart for providing this flagship smartphone. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Switching smartphone from a 10k one to 27k one is definitely a good Feeling üòÅüí´
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Actually it's a good performance device, people only defame POCO.
Value for money, I'm happy with the device.
I also have an iphone 15 pro which heats a lot at time of gaming.
Heat issues are a common factor when it comes to performance"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,This is the first review and I should say I just loved this device and it's performance üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"What a superb phone it is, fastest I have ever used, MTK D8300U is the ultimate predator in this price range. Ordered 12/512 GB.
Will update about firmware, camera performance later"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Great performance , great display and great for gaming. Camera is not the best but does good. But the 5000 mh battery doesn't feel like 5000. You need to charge the phone twice a day if u are a gamer."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Review after 54 days.
It is the best phone according to the price.
Camera 4/5 (price range)
Performance 4/5
Build quality 3/5
HyperOS 3/5
My unit does not have battery drain and heating issues."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Should have come with
IP 68 rating,
headphone jack support
or
at least 3.5mm jack to type c adapter and
sd card slot.
Camera needs a lot of improvement."

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"After using it for almost a month, i really like the phone, whether being it's snappy performance or lustrous display,rich audio. All are as said in the reviews,top notch,batter drain isn't worse but could have been batter, lasts 5 hrs sot, thanks to the incredible bundled fast charger doesn't make it seem like a big con. Yes all who purchased this phone have already convinced ourselves that we aren't gonna get flagship level camera but after buying this phone especially in this silky display,not able to capture the beautiful scenes as we enjoy is painstaking for sure. Below average is the camera. Ui side i liked it really,they have clicked the boxes for all the necessary customisations , always on display and the ability to check and reply on the always on display notifications needs to be implemented. And finding tempered glass which is edge to edge and using back cover is impossible,bid goodbye to either one. To summarise if u have a dslr or another flagship phone with nice cameras go for it .
Ll update in the future."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Camera:-pictures Getting blur,i think it's an ois sensor issue....but not at all times sometimes only

Battery:-if you are a bgmi player...you just have only 3.5 or 4 hours... without bgmi you will get 6 or 9 hours playtime

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,Heating issue is there while normal use.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Very smooth, very faster‚ö°, camera above the avarage. It can handle any game. Hyper OS is almost 99% similar as MIUI, No difference. But it's lite. Sound quality extraordinary. Definitely Flag ship mobile"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Good device but hitting issue
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"This is honestly the best midrange phone in the market. The only shortcomings are in the camera department, but in my personal opinion it actually clicks good photos. Of course not on par with the flagships of iphone and samsung. But still relatively speaking for the price, it's good.
Performance wise it's godly. The best phone for mobile gaming. Speakers are great. Haptic feedback is good. Battery and charging good. It charges to full within 45 min or so for me.
Design is meh. It's not bad. The yellow actually looks good compared to the black and grey. Camera module design is a bit all over the place. It's not compact. But it can be overlooked for the performance.
I may update this review in the future as I have had this phone for only a couple of days."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Got it yesterday and writing my initial impressions
First of all let's address the elephant in the room processor and it's performance I would say just great phone is very smooth.
About display man it's beautiful really amazing and the speakers are loud and amazing.
Now let me give this line to mention the haptic it deserves the special mention for how good it is it's just great.
Now I would talk much about battery since it's just second day with this phone I'm testing this phone intensely so it's lasting about 4-6 hours sot during this I have installed apps and games although I would uninstall them later just to test thing I have installed them. But I have to say the charging is fast for me it's very fast it get charge from 20 to 90 in about 35-40 minutes.
Now about the camera although I haven't clicked much pics but I can say if you have good light photo will come out great but if not its not that good didn't recorded any video so I'm not sure about that. I would say it's good enough for me.

I have bought this for the processor and ufs 4.0, lpddr5x storage and Ram over other phone in this price range it lives up to my expectations.

My thought before deciding to get this phone was that while other phones has better camera and clean software but I'm sure I'm going to use it till it gets all it's updates and till then other phones will definitely slow down because future software will get even more demand. Because of the processor, storage and RAM that this has will definitely help in future.

Oh yeah about clean OS I removed all the unnecessary bloatware using Universal Android Debloater if you have access to pc give it a try."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Poco the brand which is known as flagship killer
And they proved once they're the best in the market
From fan of poco f1 till it gives best performance
Camera üì∏ needs to be improved and little bit battery drain is noticeable and this time they gives amoled which is best üî•"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Nice design, Performance best, Battry and camera decent but disply and software performance best in the price segment."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Don't think about the x3 series and the past experience. Go for x6 pro and seize it. It's a great value for money with decent camera
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Very good performance, camera is ok not very good, BGMI performance is fantastic"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"I'm using this phone for the last 1 week and the camera is pretty good, charging is real quick whereas the battery drains very fast... Gaming experience is of another level.. No heating issue at all and performance is really fantastic... I am just loving this phoneüòçüòç‚ù§

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,My new mobile battery drain issue
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"I dont know why other people gloryfying this phone. I have used a lot of redmi mobiles. Thats why i chose poco this time because its the rebranded version of redmi phones. I bought the 12/512 model.But after i start to use this phone my expectations were totally broked. These are the main issues i found in my model

1. Battery draining is more. Even though normal use. Not lasting even for a day
2. There is major stuttering and smudged visuals during video playback. This happens even on camera recorded videos. This problem is only when videos are playing.every app which plays video has same effect.
3. Even though its a 1.5k amoled. Some pictures are not viewing as its orginal clarity.

I dont know why this issues hapening. Poco should have resolve these problems through next os update. Optimization is very bad.Otherwise it will badly affect integrity and goodwill of your company."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"This is the best phone in this price segment.
pros
1. best chipset

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Truly a flagship killer smartphone. Overall value for money after considering all its specifications at this price point.
1. Android 14 out of the box (+3 years Android update
2. 4nm Processor having high antutu score around 1.4 million
3. RAM extension (upto extra 8gb) from Internal Storage (UFS 4.0 type)
4. 1.5K 120 Hz Amoled Display

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"I've been using it since last two weeks,

the performance is exceptionally good, courtesy of the flagship d8300 ultra processor, it's a beast,

battery back up is good with moderate usage, gets some time to get accustomed to the hyperos and the UI,

Camera is also good enough, with some experimenting around with the camera, you can get some stunning shots,

Bought the phone for performance and performance it delivers till now, (will update rest sometime later after using more out of the device)"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,This is amazing phone at this price point. Buy it for performance not for camera.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"12gb ram and 512gb storage, you're crazy if you dont put in the extra 2k and get that version for your x6 pro.
Battery is sipped like a milkshake by the phone in performance mode with 120hertz refresh rate enabled.
If you game for 2hrs, battery goes down to 60% lol but its ok, the charger is 67w and will boost it back up in 20mins."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,Only battery draining fast problem but overall performance good...
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,I like phone performance but battery drain fast
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"If you are a camera lover please don't buy this mobile.
Day to day usage it is very good
First 2 days my battery drained very fast I don't understand the issue even phone is idel at that time also it has reduced 10 -15 %
I turned off the background sync and I reduced the screen refresh rate to normal then it is fine but not expect more than a day.
Display is very good
The processor is very good but os updates are required to more sustainable
Overall if you are looking for a good processor and display it is ok but if you need a good camera don't go for it."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"I have been using the 12/512gb varient and the phone is very light weight and feels good in hand, but the plastic back gives it a very cheap look and feel so I use the cover, moreover the battery life is decent maybe after another week of usage, I'll be able to determine the exact screen on time. The display is really good and It's visible even in Sunlight. The front camera is the best thing in this phone, this 16mp camera takes superb shots but the rear cam is average when compared with the phone's in this price range, the rear wide cam is good takes decent shots moreover cam dept can be updated through software updates and the the tone is a lil dull to my liking. The performance is amazing, every day task It can handle, gaming it can do, everything you throw at it, it'll handle with ease. (I have been using Poco X2, and when compared to that phone, The X2 has better rear cam). The phone is pretty fast and feels effortless while using!!!"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Battery is average.

The camera is good on day lights and also good at night too."

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,All rounder phone
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,The phone is superb in performance. But the only cons in this phone is battery backup. If you are a hardcore gamer than never think that you can get more than 5hr of battery backup.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Battery üîã Drain automatically, why I don't know But Display and Performance top notch...

But Samsung One Ui is always winner"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"I purchased this phone for normal usage as for this price specifications were outstanding. Two things are disappointing about this phone, one is battery and the other is the heating. The battery drains fast even at idle and the phone heats for no reason. I am charging 2 times a day with normal usage. I have not played any games so far."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Improved camera

1.Battery getting heated for normal use only
2.Draining so fast

Camera-
Ok ok

Performance wise good
Pricing should be less"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"Battery drains very fast. Biggest negative is battery drain. Camera section needs to improve. After taking a picture, for few seconds the image freezing without processing"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,All goodüëç value for money
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Pros:
* Powerful processor
* Good display. Feels smooth and responsive.
* Takes about 40 mins for 0 to 100% charging
* 3 major updates and 4 years of security updates
* Very light
* Very good pricing for specs provided (only for gamers)

Cons
* Heating during gaming: I played fortnite 60fps and temp reached 45 C but when I removed back cover the temp dropped to 42 C which is still very high.
* Battery drains very quick

This will be the best phone for gamers in 25k-30k price range if Poco solves heating and battery drain problem. I hope Poco takes this seriously for the next update."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,I am happy üòä
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,awesome for gaming

Battery performance is good, some heating issues while charging or gaming.

2) Light weight (than it's earlier models)
3) It compute power is top notching Thanks to MediaTek Dimensity 8300 SOC, UFS 4.0, LPDDRX5 RAM
4) NFC

Cons:
1) No FM Radio,
2) No 3.5 MM jack port
3) Camera can be improved (both the sides)
4) Heating issue while Gaming/Benchmark run, fast battery draining"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"For regular usage it's only downside are it's camera,slight heat and just a little bit fast battery drain...then again our normal room temperature is 40 degrees nowadays so it's completely natural otherwise everything is perfect..too good performance wise."

3. Good Battery back up..barely goes below 50% in normal usage for 10-12 hours..
4. Fast Charging..
5. Minimal heating in normal games..

Cons:
1. Average Camera...but can be substituted by 3rd party apps..
2. Calling sensor not good...keeps on turning on the screen.."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Superb flagship killer phone comes with mid range price. Hyper OS handles all tasks very well. Display bezels ratio is 94.27% almost bezel less. 512 gb storage recommended. Grey colour gives prime look. Only issue is hard to find exact tempered glass and back cover.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"As i expected, everything is good, I'm happy with the phone.
Love the camera"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Worthy mobile at this budget range and storage will be a big plus!! Go for 512 GB variant
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"12/512gb, dimensity 8300 ultra awesome processor with nice battery life feature. Camera also good. Front display fingerprint works good.
Overall I got all great features within 26200 only.
Turbo fast charging very nice features after processor and yes Very important this is my 6th mobile and past 15 years I never played games in mobile. I also have oneplus 11 but here I will never compare it because along with features money also matters."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"The display is very good and the phone is very light. Thank you Poco company, you have given us a very good phone, I am deeply grateful."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"It's a beast. Truly it was. In every aspect. It simply cruises into every task, irrespective of how hard it is, and comes out with ease. It's cool all the time. It has silky soft touch display. With 3 more OS updates and 4 years of security updates to come, it's a steal to have this mobile, which surpasses any flagship, with it's robust performance. Hope the deficit in the performance of camera gets perfect, with the firmware updates to come."

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Rear and selfie Camera is beautiful in all aspects, capture natural colors. Stabilization is good while taking videos.
Display is top notch, performance is good no doubt about it.
Charging speed is awsum. It is very handy, lightweight. Battery backup is good too. Design is beautiful. I still use poco F1 but now I can say it's successor is finally dere. You can delete pre installed apps that's a new one. In display fingerprint is lighting quick and smooth, There are better customizatioms as well. It is a very close to a complete phone in under 30-35k range right now. One can go for it without hesitation.
Poco has improved there phones a lot."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Osm Display üòç
Performance is top notch

Front camera actually good
Iam facing Battery üîãissue
Battery drains fast
Performance is first priority then go for it
I just buy this product for BGMI It's run very smoothly
Just loved it üòç"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"I will review it based on 5 criteria
1) Camera- above average, not very excellent but not bad also.
2)Battery- charging is very fast (takes about 50 mins to get fully charged) but similarly battery drain is also fast. If your use is extensive you might have to charge it 2 times per day.
3) Display- one of the best display ever, AMOLED and HDR display is one of the best i have ever seen.
4) Performance- performance is very fast due to very good processor.
Only issue is that the phone gets heated up very quickly even while doing basic task like video calling, so might need to keep it constantly under AC/fan.
5) Design- personally I like the design very much, especially the leather back.

Also it has xiomihyper OS and LPDDRX5 and UFS 4.0 which is really good.

So should you buy it? I think 12gb 512gb model is worth it if you are looking for performance and display ordiented phone and if you are getting a deal in less than 24k."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Nice
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Awesome phone, if you want performance just go for it. You will love it"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Over heating issues in 90fps gaming and battery draining.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Don't think just go for it if you need a performance centric phone.
Camera is also good.
Edit - battery optimisation is really bad. Battery is draining really fast. You can play Bgmi on 90fps, using 5G mobile data, 3 hour max on full charge."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Performance is satisfactory ,camera and battery is also very good. Best phone for normal use under 30k."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Pro- Excellent Display, punchi colours, smooth and fast. Performance Beast. Handles every task like butter.
Feels light in hand. The Cameras are not that bad that people thoughts. The main camera actually performs better than my earlier Redmi Note 10 pro phone.
Latest superfast Ram DDR5 and UFS 4 storage memory are take this phone in the Premium segment.

Cons- Phone feels heat when using camera and while playing games even for 10...15 minutes of use. These are winter days and if the heating is can be feeling then think what will happened in the upcoming summer.
Design is good but not that. The Phone is performance oriented but the Bulky, big round Back Cameras popups more though they not perform that best.
Buttons are very shaky and made of cheap plastic, It fees.

Final conclusion is best for Gaming and decent photography. But so delicate. If it gets drop from the shirt pocket hight, it will definitely crack the complete body. So be careful."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"1. Big issue with battery. Draining too fast - 3/5
2. Camera is below average but because of AI features come up - 2/5
3. Display is good - 3/5
4. Performance is also good - 4/5
5. Design - Attaching dust to fast around the Camera - 3/5.

Facing Frequently connection issue while gaming.

Facing issue with file manager. Not able to delete folders from the file manager.

I exchange the device two times but after going to Flipkart godown they reduce the price of device too much I don't know why. Even though my device condition is good, I also mentioned all things about the exchange device at the time of order."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,Silently Omitting a 3.5mm jack is not a good trend. The missing Micro SD card is another feature that will hurt in future.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Many reviews says
Battery issues
Heating issues
Virtual proximity sensor issue
But there nothing like this , I have using this phone for more than 7 days. My last phone was x3 but now I have x6 pro.
It's performance is truly beast.
I have been playing bgmi almost whole day, it's battey is performing very great."

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"I am writing this review after used of 2 months.
Mobile performance is super but battery is behaving as if it is 3000mah. Have to charge twice even for normal use/ no use. Really need battery optimisation"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,overall phone is gud but the worst part of is extreme level heating issue and high level of battry draining issue fix this in the future.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Mixed thoughts after buying this mobile.

Pros:
1.Performance: The phone delivers commendable performance for smooth usage.
2.Display Quality: The display is good, providing a satisfying visual experience.

Cons:
1.Charging Time: Despite the 67W charger, the device takes longer than expected to charge, which could be a concern for users seeking quick recharges.
2.Poor Camera Quality: The camera falls short in delivering satisfactory image quality.
3.Short Battery Life: The battery drains quickly, lasting only half a day on average usage.

4.Outdated Design: The phone's design feels old and might not appeal to those looking for a modern aesthetic."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"Camera is bad.
Low light and night times the camera performance is worst.
Good processor Performance.
Network strength is lesser.
Battery is Ok.
Display is not up to the 1.5k 120hz. Average display compared to other AMOLED mobiles."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,VERY NICE PERFORMANCE BUT THIS HAVE A MAIN ISSUE IS BATTERY DRIAN IF U R OK WITH IT THIS IS A KILLER üòà
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Best in this price segment
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Budget friendly performance beast..... selfie cam is good but rear cam is compromised...stereo surround sound...
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Phone is so light weight you can't even imagine, battery backup 5000mah is not upto the mark, quick charging is good, camera is ok not upto the mark photo get blurry when you zoom it."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"It's been 3 months since I got this device the price was 28k that time now it's 25499 for 12/512.

The cons are..
#bettry drained too quickly and #heating issue if using camera outside or while playing game like COD or BGMI

Pro's-
Performance is unbeatable in this price range
Portrait camera work's good it was not expected as it was a gaming phone"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Good Screen, feels great except Camera (Seriously). Lot to improve. My POCO F5 has a great camera with stabilization. Choose F6."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"This is a very good smartphone for its price. There are some short-comings here and there but overall it's very good. Shortcomings include that its camera is not really good, the battery drains very fast and the most annoying thing is that it heats up very fast even in normal usage. If we keep the shortcomings aside then it really is a brilliant smartphone. The company also tells us that we get 3 years of OS updates and 4 years of security updates, so problems regarding battery drain and overheating might get resolved in future updates. And i bought this phone in may 2024. There is one way to save it from battery drainage and overheating that is turn on battery saver, I found it after using it for a couple of days."

I have observed many other glitches. I think this phone has good specs but is definitely not optimised. One reason that this phone can't be compared with the premium segment even with high end specs. My suggestion is not to buy this phone for now."

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Didn't even install any app already too many bloatwares, and it started lagging while using chrome for the 1st time. Also build quality is so light and cheap that it feels like it can break or get damaged any moment. So much hyped about the display and processor, but it couldn't play 4K HDR video without frame drops. Also even 4K video seemd like pixelated. My 3 year old realme was way better than this trash. I used to keep open 70 tabs in chrome and plenty of apps in background but it never ever lagged in those 3 years."

And the hyperos is very good and they have many customisation on it. For me I am very satisfied with the poco phones."

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Product is awesome but Flipkart's service was as usual,PATHETIC.

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,I wanted to buy M34 Samsung phone but didn't buy. And it was a mistake to buy poco x6 pro. I don't play games etc so don't much care about performance but I do care about battery and camera. And this phone seriously lack at both. If you want a device to play games then go for it.

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,One of the best mobile in this price
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Absolutely perfect mobile
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Very good product as per it's cost.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Cool
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,All is well
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Product is good but battery is not good battery drain very fast
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Very good phone.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"The performance of the poco x6 pro is outstanding especially in gamming, camera is above average, battery backup in normal use it gives you one day backup if you heavy user it gives 7 to 8 hrs, sound quality is very good"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,The product is one of the best in performance as expected from POCO.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"This phone is a total game changer esp. if you are into high performance devices as an enthusiast. The features which it has are rare in even 70 K devices. A curved display and a slightly smaller front camera hole would have been better. But with such a latest processor and chipset, 12 GB RAM, UFS 4.0, OIS, Vegan leather back and very light weight profile, this is quite a delight.

Just to clarify, this smartphone is NOT for those who want the best camera, best display or the best gaming device.

It is a device with 13 Lacs plus Antutu benchmark score.
HyperOS is almost like MIUI.

The delivery experience (not the individual who came) was not upto the mark though.

Kudoz to Xiaomi and Poco for such a great piece of tech thought and a real world smart marvel."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Battery life improved after the last update. It offers excellent value for the money. Nothing sort of a flagship mobile. No regret.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Good phone, with decent battery life.
HyperOs have lots of glitches that need improvement.
The camera is the worst."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Excellent
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,plz solve heating problem otherwise to good üëç
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Just awesome...
In this segment, it gives every flagship technology... Just unbelievable...
The most important thing is that while using any app I'm not facing any ads issue.
But there are many other brands also who're giving advanced technology in this budget, and then we are facing ads issues in the inbuilt apps (File manager, maps, etc)"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Best. Mobile to buy
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"Initial Impression of Poco x6 Pro
1. Setting up phone is difficult. Have to search to check user agreement.
2. Battery draining very fast with normal use. Hope this stabilizes in few days
3. Phone getting hot with normal use
4. HyperOS is similar to MIUI
5. Cannot uninstall GoogleTv, Getapps, and Security app
6. Security app has inbuilt antivirus and it cannot be uninstalled. So, cannot use antivirus of my choice as two antivirus will slow down device
7. Reading news on Chrome 30 minutes drains battery 5%
8. Camera is good enough
9. Phone charges quickly with provided 67w charger
10. Device does not look premium like 27k cost
11. I feel back fingerprint reader is more practical than in-display fingerprint reader
12. Ads much lesser than older Poco phones
13. If you are not getting OTP, go to Settings; Mobile Networks ; SIM Card settings; turn off Make calls via WiFi

Edit: After 2 months usage, to reduce heating
1. Turn off notifications for most apps
2. Select Battery aver for most apps
3. Set refresh rate to 60 Hz
4. Search in Settings to Turn off animations
5. Chrome - Settings - Site Settings - Data Stored - Delete data
6. Enable dark mode
7. Use 4G LTE, instead of 5G
8. Under Location -Turn off Wifi and Bluetooth scanning

To increase battery backup, do this once or twice:
1. Use phone and allow battery to reach 0%
2. Switch off phone
3. Charge to 100%
4. Disconnect charger and then switch on phone

Update after 3 weeks usage:
14. Call quality is bad. Person on other side cannot hear me.
15. Latest system update did not fix any problems.

POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Poco x6 Pro wonderful smartphone thank you Flipkart performance high level display high level
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Too many irritating bugs
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Best in price sector...
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Battery performance is not good as I expected.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Beautiful display with smooth performance although weak body. But worth it. No heating issue
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Best phone yellow 12ram and 512 internal storge
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Best in price range.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,Don't buy this product eating problem not good
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,good perforamce
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,Except camera Quality remaining is good at this price
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,Good performance in this price segment..
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,The camera is good. But the battery drains fast and the display is okay and next about the performance then it is good but not for a long time gaming it heats up quickly and you can not play using the high settings of the game. If you would then it heats up quickly and heats with a very high temperature.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Everything is good except once google chrome crashed (due to bug)
I am wondering what will happen in future.
But yet it is very good for now"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"This is amazing product from poco.
Battery backup is amazing.
Performance is next level.
Yello vegan leather design is superb.
Camera is not that great but decent."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,I request to Poco solve the heating problem and battery drain problem by software. Otherwise this price range with this specification best mobile.
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,3,"Battery drainage very fast without using any application
Rest phone is good üëç"
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,"Nice phone. Good for it. Don't study too much. If Ur budget comes to this range, it is the best phone."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Good Phone with 1.5k display 120Hz , Battery is good for normal tasks , but if you play games like bgmi which is a very heavy game , then max 3 to 4 hours back up then you connect the charger and play no problem.
Now if you play a normal game like asphalt 9 or stumble guys or cod,the phone gets warmer , if you play bgmi for 45 minutes the phone gets uncomfortable on top, the left hand suffers , having an AC or mini fan is a must for bgmi . I bought the phone for normal usage by seeing the specs at an incredible price and it is surely value for money at 2024 January .Some bugs are there in the phone."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"Other than the battery life, great phone. Day to day performance is awesome. No lags. I haven't tried any games or photoshop or any of those heavy apps."
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,OK
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,5,I have really a fantastic experience
POCO_X6_Pro 5G,4,"It's very well in terms of performance. Camera is decent. Battery I found a bit underperforming when I see bettry usage. Most of the portion is taken by Google. But other than this it's too good.
Design is also quiet well. But it's difficult to use it by 1 hand only. You will have to use 2 hands while using it because it's size is big.

Hence 4 stars. I needed a device with exceptional performance in lowest budget. I found 1.
Also there's virtual RAM"

realme 12 Pro+ 5G,4,"Review after using for 1 month.

Pros - 1. Excellent Camera with Telescopic lens with 120X Zoom. The beauty of capturing the moon is something great.

2. Design is good and resembles Rolex watch.

3. Lesser weight. Good for those using for longer duration

4. Excellent display .

5. Faster Touch response.

6. Fast charging in 40 mins.

Cons - Major issue found is overheating of the phone. Particularly if one is in Teams / Zoom concall . Due to overheating ,the plastic scratch guard which came along with the product ,have developed bubbles on the surface. Then battery drains faster .

Overall, a good phone."

I purchased it 02 weeks ago only.
Performance is like eating a piece of cake. No lag found. Maybe i will revist the review after 6months of usage.

Cons:
Battery performance is not that great compared to my old mobile redmi note 9 pro max.
I have to charge my mobile every day. Battery power should have been targetted for 5500mah or above.

Display resolution is good and gaming performance for cricket kind of games were trued and found no lag. Only battery , i found should be improved.

Cons:

If you are transfering thirdparty apps or pirate apps from old phone, just check this phone O.S. needs 64bit version of it. All Apps are not Compatabile."

This phone is the best phone when compared to pricey phones like Apple, Vivo, Xiaomi and One Plus. Zoom is superb 120x digital. I exchanged it with my Oppo Reno 10 5g. In four years battery will go down by 20% only. For extra storage with amoled display, Techno Prova Pro 6 5g and One Plus CE4 may be great and second option. I have also Techno Phantom V Fold which is also a great all rounder phone with great cameras, rear and front. I use them all for different purposes. NFC should have been provided."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Camera and a performance Beast!
Been using it for 10 days now and here's the summary:-

PROS:
-Camera__Nightography is insanely good. Beats iPhone14 and other top flagship phones by far. Portraits are a bliss for the eyes, feels like shot from DSLR.
-Performance__Super smooth performance with 8 gen 1. Can handle any mobile games flawlessly. Played BGMI and Asphalt 9 and there are hardly any frame drops even after an hour.
-Display__Display is too good. Peak brightness is enough and works brilliantly even during noon. Bezels are so slim it feels like holding just the screen.
-Design__In hand feel is Premium. Thought the s22 would be smaller but it actually fits perfectly and probably better than the s22+. Back glass looks super Premium.

CONS
-Battey__It's a big setback for this flagship Beast. Lasts 24hrs only in standby or if you pass half the time not using the phone. Barely lasts 12 hrs with a little bit of camera and ~1hr of gaming. Reason for a less star
-Heating__Heats a lot while playing games or recording videos. Would suggest doing these without a back cover for better performance.

OVERALL it's a steal @39999 just for the camera and performance. I genuinely prefer only these 2 and it doesn't bother me to charge the phone a couple of times or carry a powerbank so the cons are fine by me. But if you want your phone to last for a day or prefer bigger screen/storage there are better options in this price range.

Hope this helps üòÉ"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Writing this review after a month usage. Bought it in BBD for 38k.
1) Display : top notch, touch is like butter smooth
2) Camera : In better lightimg conditions photos are exceptional while in low light it struggles a bit. Portrait mode is awesome.
3) Battery : i use to charge for 85% and it lasts for a day. Fast charge is superb. Frm 10 - 85% charge, it takes around 50mins. I DON'T FIND NY HEATING ISSUE."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,best in class
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Camera is too cool
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Everything is great except the battery , doesn't even last 12 hrs or even 8 hrs if used properly, have to charge multiple times ü•≤"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Pros:-
1)Size n Design
2)Camera Quality
3)Display
4)Processor
Cons:-
1) Battery life üòë

Day 1 to 3 Battery hardly lasts for 2hr Screen time. I was so afraid and also planned to return the product. But resolved in few steps.

STEP 1:- Use Wifi insted of mobile data.
STEP 2:- Use in Power Saving mode
STEP 3:- Dont use Super Fast charging, Use Fast Charging insted. (CAN change in settings)
Only for a week, then you can change the setting once the battery is set.
STEP 4:- USE only one physical sim(Can use e-sim secondary)....."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Camera is super good.... decent performance.... battery drains really fast and heating issue is still there but it has been resolved to some extent
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Amazing product under 40k , i like it , FANTASTIC performance, decent phone with great performance, looks,cameras etc."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Phone is very Handy and camera Quality is awesome and 16bit Raw click is make this phone killer in this price segment. Due havy processor some time it get heating Issue but it manageable. Over-all Phone performance of this phone is Excellent.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Product is good very handy good display but need to improve on battery as it does not last whole day
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,The only drawback is HEATING which causes rapid decrease in battery percentage and ANDROID 13 adds more jolt to it. Hope that company optimises this through a stable update. And for rest this the only thing i need to say (BEAST COMPACT FLAGSHIP)

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,All Good Good
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Camera - photos are excellent. videos are also good but not the best.

display - highest grade.

performace - top notch. No lag whatsoever.

battery - Oh well. Not good. But works for me as i am not a heavy user. 100 to 20% in 20hours of easy to medium usage of phone which includes some video calls, lots of calls, lots of messaging. some photography.

overall - A good phone for a person who just takes calls, reply to messages some social media and doesnt game that much."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Overall a great deal for moderate users!
Display and camera quality is just amazing.
Phone is small and handy and feels premium.

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,It's truly a tiny beast. Awesome camera and display
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Best camera for photography , prosessing was awsome, slightly heat issue when using camera , hope it will fix soon"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Overall the performance of the mobile is excellent. Samsung Galaxy S22 is a compact high end device with every feature integrated inside it. I fell the draw back of the mobile is the battery. You have to charge your mobile two time in a day if you are using it excessively.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,I got the best phone in BBD sales and also I like him most because it has an awesome camera and performance is also superb. One disappointing thing is the battery if you use your phone continuously it takes two times a charge in a day. But overall the best phone I got
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"The Samsung S22 is a phone that has some great features, but also some significant drawbacks. One of the biggest issues with this phone is its battery life. The battery drains quickly, even with normal use, and it can be frustrating to constantly have to charge the phone throughout the day. This is definitely a disadvantage for users who are always on-the-go and need a phone that can keep up with their busy lifestyle.

However, the Samsung S22 also has some standout features that make it a worthwhile purchase for some users. The display on this phone is fantastic, with crisp and vibrant colors that really pop. Whether you're watching videos, browsing the internet, or playing games, the display is sure to impress.

Another area where the Samsung S22 excels is in its performance. The phone is equipped with a powerful Snapdragon processor that delivers fast and smooth performance for all your daily tasks. Whether you're multitasking between apps or running demanding games, the Samsung S22 can handle it all with ease.

Overall, the Samsung S22 is a phone that has its ups and downs. While the battery life can be frustrating, the display and performance are both excellent. If you prioritize a great display and fast performance over battery life, then the Samsung S22 may be the perfect phone for you."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Best camera phone in this price range,performance is also great but battery is very bad,display is very good,it's a great deal if you love photography."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Camera performance super videography super but battery life low over heating
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Ghaint Phone
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Before buying this product I have heard many times that this battery doesn't lasts long even a day but wanted to buy this phone at any cost because this one problem was not a deal breaker and I love Samsung phones especially their display design and camera. But believe me after buying this phone even though I got less screen time but after using 2 to 3 weeks the phone gets adapt to the usage and gets optimized and I have easily got about 4.5 to 5 hours easily and I am a moderate user casual games, video streaming, social media and lot of phone calls.
Don't revert your decision hearing from people about it's battery believe me it's worth it."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"This Phone is GEM but except battery. Battery is very very poor like 3-4 Hours screen time with medium heavy usage,
If samsung control the processor clock speed in low freq then phone is beast"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Delight to use. Feels premium I hand. Only negative side is battery back-up. Need to charge every day at 3pm if I start the day with 100% charge.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"The design and look are awesome,
Day mode camera üì∏ Good, but the the night mode camera üì∏ not Good. Performance Super, no lag, Battery üîã so poor, heating issue, when you are the 120hz refresh rate used, but you change refresh rate 60 hz then not any heating issue."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Writing this device review after 15 days of using,
I got this phone at 34k. This is a fully packed mobile with lots of good features and specs. Battery easily lasts for more than 5.5hrs (100% to 25-20%) in simple + moderate use (on 60hz) and also 25watt charging is superfast according to 3700 mah battery capacity. It tooks 50-60 minutes to get fully charged and in 20 minutes, it charges the device to 50% with original Samsung Charger. This phone targets simple user who are not always active on their mobile screen. Camera, Performance, Display, In-Hand feeling all are really premium. Please do update to the latest Android version for smooth experience and good battery life. During first 3-4 days, the UI will learn your usage pattern and then it will optimise the phone's battery according to your usage and i also don't feel any kind of over heating while testing it with heavy games and application, it only gets warm which is very common in every phone. If you're a heavy user or looking for good battery phone which can last upto or more than 6hrs, then go with OnePlus and IQOO. I was also looking for Nothing phone 2 but it is still a new brand so trust issues are obvious. I was looking for a handy and flat display phone with Clean UI and good features, This device really matched my requirements."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,This was such a great buy and a great value for money phone currently.. If u can adjust with battery and little bit heating issues u can go for it.. I choose this phone becuase of its compact looks beezellees display and premium design.. But currently i recommend u must extend a little budget and go with s23.. there us not much difference in both this phone but s23 will provide a more years of updates and it doesn't have heating issue..
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"been using this phone for 7 days now, got this beauty for only 31k so will be keeping that in mind
if you are heavy user and use your phone for gaming and only like to charge your phone once a day, dont buy this.
if you can ignore that and and want to have a pho ne for content consumption. go for it
everything is top notch, the build quality, the camera, the UI, the processor, the size like everything is perfect
and for the price of 31k i can ignore the battery thing. i use this phone for music, videos and work and get around 6 hours for backup.
and the phone dont heat, it has not happened, i did play some heavy games just to check, no heating as of now."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"This is a amazing camera and performance,, and this design is so awesome but battery backup is weak but it's amazing üëç"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"The Samsung Galaxy S22 is a compact flagship phone with a beautiful design, great cameras, and fast software updates. However, its battery life is underwhelming, and it has high idle battery drain.

Pros:

Beautiful design
Great camera
Fast software updates
Compact size

Cons:

Bad battery life
High idle battery drain

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S22 is a great phone, but its battery life is a major drawback. If you're looking for a compact flagship phone with a great camera and fast software updates, the S22 is a good option, but be prepared to carry a charger with you.

Here are some additional thoughts on the S22's battery life:

The S22 has a relatively small battery, at 3,700mAh. This is less than the batteries in many other flagship phones.

The S22's battery life can be especially poor if you use it for demanding tasks, such as gaming or video streaming.

S22 has high idle battery drain, meaning that it loses battery even when you're not using it actively.

If you're considering buying an S22, it's important to be aware of its battery life limitations. If you're a heavy user, or if you need your phone to last all day on a single charge, you may want to consider a different phone.

As battery backup isn't an issue for me hence giving 4 stars."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Overall the phone is fabulous except for the battery.
Display is awesome as always stunning OLED display.
Camera is also great up to the mark
But when comes to battery device goes down ..
Observed heating issue while using camera.
Over all iam satisfied with the device .

And I was planning to give 5 star rating but due to 2 factors I I have rated the device 4 only
1. As already mentioned battery is too low compared with other phones in market .
2. In case of this full credit goes to Flipkart ...they are charging. 40 rupees for secure packing .but till now I couldn't find out what safety was there ... same old package of Flipkart with out any changes no any airbubles protection nothing just the paper box ..and we are paying extra rupees for this same packing.
@flipkart requesting your team to add any special secure package for fragile things and charge the money. Just for the old package please don't charge any extras.
If the secure package was ok then also I would have rated as 5."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"So anyone having second thoughts for this phone, trust me just buy this beautiful piece of art. The battery is good if you are a normal user, it charges fast so no issues but apart from battery bro everything is beautiful, its camera, its display, its sleek design every thing. Must buy"

It's performance is very good ( having sanpdrogen 8 gen1). but it heat up a little bit which is not a major problem. Is is waterproof. It's camera is better then iphone 12, as I tested it or 13 as well. And it feels slightly smaller then iphone 12. It's display is just insane. BGMI runs in full setting no lagg even in rush . But you have to charge it frequently for heavy gaming . I would recommend it .........üòåüòå"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,It's awesome product justin case if you ignore battery uses it will be a good product for office purpose and professional uses
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Camara is osm but heating issue and battery's life is very low
My feedback phone is very osm and heandy phone"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"A tough competitor for iPhone 13
Awesome zoom 30x
Great portrait pics
Handy device
Good battery life
Fast processor
Worthy S series device"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"Very good Camera.
Battery life is poor, by end of day with normal usage it is almost dead. With battery less than 10% don't depend on phone for next day's morning alarm. Even with Wifi, Mobile network being off it dies down
Major issue that I have is poor face and fingerprint detection. Even with same facial exposure sometimes it gives error as Face not detected. Same with fingerprint too. Sometimes you need to press so hard multiple times. Real real issue at times of emergency. I love my iPhone 14 for the facial Recognition feature.
Performance otherwise is excellent, smooth typing, good display and overall with heavy duty Apps."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Excellent..best performance..best buy
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"Only Camera phone.

Performance not upto the mark, Ram management is not good. Battery life is bad. Hardly I get 4hrs of SOT from 85% to 5%.

If you just want a compact phone with good cameras then only I will suggest you to buy this otherwise skip"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"Battery is bad, except battery phone is overall good, but if you are a heavy user you need to charge your phone thrice a day...except battery photos are awesome, display quality is at his best, inland feel is fantastic.."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,What a beautiful phone....performed like a beast...camera quality awsome...just go for it without hesitation....
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Battery is fine, last upto 24-28 hrs with normal usage. 4/5
Dolby atmos sound quality is superb.5/5 Fingerprint sensor is not good -3/5
Camera and features 5/5"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"The good:
- SPOT ON size, weight and in hand feel (actually feels like a phone in hand, rather than a big brick)
- Outstanding build quality
- Aesthetic design that is just beautiful to look at, especially if you go for the matte black color
(Better than the latest S series and iPhones in my opinion)
- Impressive Camera quality (both for pictures and videos)
- Clean, smooth, vivid and high quality display as expected from Samsung
- Good call and speaker quality
- Received Android 14 updated with One UI 6.0 (6.1 expected soon)

The not so good:
- Upon heavy usage, heats up like a pan
- Battery life is a HUGE limitation, must carry a power bank or charger around when travelling

I'm able to live with the limitations as I like to keep my phone usage quite low, and I have access to charging sockets throughout the day."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Best mobile For camera But hit problem üòï and battery backup üòí
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Nice one
But battery back up is decent"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"How can you make a product soo good yet soo bad.
I am stunned at the level of incompetence that Samsung has done with the battery here.
I mean you would love the phone everything that it is capable of, the speed, the camera, the display (phenomenal) and then you see your battery dying 1% every 3 minutes in even in battery saver mode."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Awesome Camera
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Samsung s22 is the champ and maybe also called as android of iPhone. It literally seems to be powerhouse while during multitasking and also while gaming. It will only throttle when it gets hot. Camera is also good and gives good quality images and also night mode is good üëç. If you want a one hand compact phone and also want beast performance while doing gaming. Then you can go for this phone. Only con in this phone is the battery. It's 3700 and I need to charge twice a day as my usage. So buy before you do your research on this phone.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Terrific camera...
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Amazing product,value for money, Camera is awesome and delivered same dayüòçüòçüòç"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,The photographic performance decreased after updating
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"I bought this phone on BBD sale. It's working fine till now.
Pros:
1. Phone size is perfect.
2. Smooth performance .
3. Camera is good.

Cons:
1. Battery performance is not good for heavy users.
2. Heating issue is there.
3. Fingerprint sensor is a bit slow."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Looks, camera design very nice
Overall loves this phone"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Over all it is a amazing flagship phone but with little heat issue.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Im using this for past 4 months from oct 2023. Phone is smooth and nice..Everything is good but.. Im facing heat issue while taking photos and videos I don't know is this normal. Battery is draining fast as per the usage..Max 8hr screen time is for 100%...
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Everything in this mobile is as per flagship standard except battery, this phone has very poor battery life, one should carry a PowerBank if going out for a longer period of time. Display is just 1080p. Performance is good."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Best phone in the price , fast delivery by Flipkart.. Battery would have been better."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"This is the my opinion for s22 after 1 month of use.
For 39,999 I think it's best flagship with Lot of features and stable UI . But main problem of this device is the battery 3700 mAh battery is not enough for one full day use. Anyone who is comfortable with charging twice a day like me then you can go for this. And one this on 5G network it consumes more battery."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Before I proceed with the review, let me tell you that this is going to be my secondary device. My primary device is still an iPhone.
As a secondary device, this is an all-round good phone.

Here are some of my initial impressions-

1. Good display with adequate outdoor brightness.
2. Compact size- this is one of the best features of this phone.
3. Good set of cameras.
4. Some useful features like Samsung Pay, DeX mode comes handy at times.
5. Performance is good- no major lag while casually using the device.
6. Heating is there, but it's manageable.
7. Speakers are decent.
8. Fingerprint scanner is somewhat good. If you have really dry hands (which some of us have during winters), then fingerprint scanner becomes unreliable at times.
9. Battery is decent. If you casually use this device, then the device will last for a typical working day. If you're a medium or heavy user, then please be prepared to carry a power-bank with you.
10. Build quality is good.

To conclude, I would say, if you're getting this device under 40K, and you're in market for a compact device, then go for this one. Remember, this phone is not meant for heavy usage. And as a secondary device, this serves the purpose well."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Really great device.
BUILD QUALITY is really awesome all metal frame, glass back, flat display, compact size, everything is great.
BATTERY is a bit disappointing but suits Samsung's Fame it hardly gives 3 hours of screen on time.
HEATING is also a point in the device, it starts heating just under small pressure."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Title: Excellent All-Round Performer!

Review:
Purchased the Samsung S22 during the Big Billion Sale at Rs.40,000, and I must say it's a fantastic device overall. The camera is truly awesome, capturing stunning moments with clarity. The 6-inch size strikes a perfect balance between being handy and providing an immersive viewing experience. The metal finishing adds a premium touch to the design. The mind-blowing Dolby Atmos experience delivers unparalleled sound clarity, making every audio moment a pleasure. The display is excellent, providing vibrant and crisp visuals. However, the only downside is the battery backup with 3700 mAh, which could be better. Despite this, it's a solid purchase for its features and the discounted price during the sale."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,If you need specially a camera mobile then go for it for sure coz it's camera quality is better than i phone 15 or 15 plus coz my wife has 15 plus.....not suitable for heavy user..!!

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Fantastic Phone with a Few Quirks

I recently got my hands on the Samsung S22, and it's an awesome phone! The design is top-notch, and the compact size makes it incredibly handy. The display is stunning, providing an immersive experience.

While the battery backup is not the strongest, it's manageable for about two days. Initially, I faced some heating issues, which raised concerns. However, after two days, it normalized. I still notice a bit of heat during video and photo capture, but I assume it's within the normal range.

Despite these minor quirks, I love this phone! It's a great buy considering its overall performance and design."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Samsung never disappointed us. S series üôå üëåüèª
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,It's a good choice. I got in 40k and better than iphone
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"This is an almost perfect smartphone for anyone looking for a combination of good camera and good performance but, and it's a BIG 'BUT', the BATTERY!!!!!

Coming straight to the point, this phone has it all covered with good screen, great camera, great performance and OneUI is just cherry on top.

But to enjoy all these things you would need a great batter, at least a decent one! And this phone lacks that!

I have used this phone in almost every condition. Indoors, outdoors, while travelling or while working.

And everywhere I face the same issue! the battery just drains like anything!

If you properly use this phone then you will have to charge it every 3 to 4 hours depending on your usage.

Even at very light usage you will have to charge this phone at least twice to go through a working day!

Other than that, there's no area you will complain on! I love this device. Just hopped that the batter was better!"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,Mobile battery backup is very poor
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Best in camera, battery life average"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Great product
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"I got this S22 and my friend has S23 Ultra, to be honest S22's camera turned out to be better than S23 Ultra.
Amazing display adaptive brightness even in sunlight.
Everything is perfect except one thing which i would like to mention is that when we use camera for sometime the device is getting heated up and the battery drains like an iphone."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"The phone is awesome and very premium by looks. It's very impressive when you hold it in and a very satisfying grip. Battery back up is bit low but manageable if you are not a hard core user. Gets heat when camera is used for a longer time.

Camera and display are very good and captures very natural colors. Videos at uhd 60 are really awesome and gives a feeling of live video. Very handy and easy to use single handedly.

I'm using it since a month and very happy to get it at 40k. The UI got recently updated with great modifications in notification bar, camera, gallery and other features like movable lock screen clock and customised side panel.

Overall its a great phone foe the users who aren5 iphone fans and fans to use a premium phone under 50k..

Display is a top notch with excellent brightness level."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Samsung just missed the opportunity of making the best phone.
This phone has everything we need except battery life.
This phone is having the best camera which can beat any smartphone of this price range, even the above ones too.
Size is compact and it is a premium device.
But the battery, battery is the most frustrating factor about this one.
It gets drained even if one is not using the phone.
One full charge with good usage will last max to max 6 hours.

If one can ignore the battery aspect, then this is the best phone.
For photographers, this is a treat."

Camera-
Great Camera quality, Selfie camera is even better than iPhone 15 pro. Auto focus works great. Zoom-in and out works super great.

Only drawback is that if you want to click yourself with a great background such as sunrise or other, it might skip the background.

Performance -
Great.

Battery -
Biggest con of this phone is battery which runs only for around 6-7 hours of usage and with camera which is essential on a trip will go down up to 4-5 hours. Had to carry a power Bank with it all the time."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Pros
* Impressive camera quality and vibrant display.

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Really nice and handy mobile love the camera and nice display
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,The phone overheats and discharges by evening with normal usage. This is probably because of the SD 8gen1. Other than that the phone is stunning. Performance is very smooth and fast.

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"I order bora purple and I'm pretty satisfied with its premium feel in hand, the only issue with S22 is its battery, although for decent usage it lasts throughout the day, but you need to charge at night, if not charged at night, battery loss is around 10%
Camera quality is way too good."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Let's not talk about other features..people wnt to know about battery.
So the battery of this phone is small (3700mah) because you can't put big battery in a compact design phone..if you want a big battery in this compact form factor phone, it's like you wanna drive a sports car with a Volvo truck fuel tank..this can't be happen bro..
Both things cannot be together..like mkbhd says it's an iPhone of android world.

Display on this device is probably the best display one can get in this segment.
Having used the phone for past 5 days, the battery life also doesn't seem to be a problem as I was able to get a full day's battery backup with a sort of casual usage. Also no issue of over heating as such during normal usage of the phone.

don't buy if you are a heavy user. For normal user you can manage with it. Performance is above average, but not the best. But the biggest drawback is that battery. It can't last for more than 4hrs of screen on time. You have to ready to charge twice a day even if you are a normal user."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Good and handy
Works totally fine
Yes battery quite disappointed but good as per 3700mah
Camera quality is best"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Definitely a very good perfoming phone. One of the best looking and compact phone.
Camera is very good but images seem sharp to me personally. Also, color doesn't come out very natural if lighting is not very good. A pink colored shirt looks reddish pink (i think the image got saturated).
Battery is fine for a normal user like me.

I ordered the phone in white color and received the cable in black haha, that's the only complaint!"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Awesome üëå
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"I absolutely love this phone. I already have a Samsung S21 ultra and I loved how the One UI has improved a lot. I was using an Old Oneplus 6 as my work phone and it had started lagging for me so I upgraded to S22 and fell in love with it. The compact size is something which is making me prefer this phone over my S21 ultra. The performance is smooth and it is truly a flagship.

The only drawback as everyone has mentioned is the battery, but I am using this phone just for my official work so I haven't had much issue with it and also if it comes to it I don't mind charging it 2 times in a day if needed, as I already have my primary phone for my private usage when this one is on charge.

If somebody is looking to use this as a primary phone and is a heavy user then Battery is something which they'll have to take I to consideration, but if multiple charging is not and issue go for it blindly. I bought it during the BBD sale at 39k and I don't regret this purchase at all. I'm really happy with the purchase"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Display is very smooth and clear
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Liked the Product a lot. I heard about the battery drain but I didn't found as such. Easily getting 5 hours of SOT. Display is very good. You can rely on camera performance. I like the software it is really very good.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Ow some performance
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"So beautiful, So elegant, Just looking like a WOW!üòÖ"

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Product is and feels premium and compact on hand and the screen is awesome

just a con is the small battery which does not last for a day if you are rapid user other than that a little much of heating while multi tasking for a long time

PS- remember to use a case it is so much slippery on hand due to mate glass back and the curved alumunium edges"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Using this phone for a week now....nice camera, perfect design and size and very nice to hold, battery is fine if you dont play games a lot."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Nice
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,Very low battery
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"I replaced my old Samsung S9 Plus with this. Very disappointed with battery life and heating problems. Battery lasts for less than a day with normal basic usage with calls, email checks and some financial transactions. Phone overheats especially when using Google maps. If you connect to car charger while using Google maps, it gives a pop up message about overheat after sometime and stops Google maps. I had called Samsung service and even visited service centre but they did basic checks and returned my phone saying they couldn't find any issues and washed off their hands. Service centre people even suggested to use original Samsung Charger but they don't sell car chargers and just gave random reason. Camera quality is bad especially when I used in auditorium event setups to capture performance. Both photos and videos came out bad and grainy. However, photos come out very good if you use in outside on normal day light. Some night shots also were good."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Battery and heat main problem
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Exalent in all but heating some times but it controls shortly
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Overall a best product
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Mind blowing phone,i love it"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"My very first flagship phone and I have to say it's an all-rounder but the battery and heating issue disappointed me big time. The camera is good but the image processing could have been better. And to not include at least a charger for a phone of this price was a bummer. You need to charge it at least thrice a day if you're using Internet the whole day, heavy gaming can cause heating faster and the battery *surprise surprise* more than average. So you can't actually have a prolonged gaming session with it.
Other than these cons, the phone is beautiful, compact and easy to hold for small hands. The snapdragon processor makes the phone work fast. Hope I can use this phone for a while ü•π"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"Cons: battery draining and over heating issues, camera is average"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"Phone is excellent days and camera everything is good but....


battery is very bad üò°ü§¨ü§¨"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Review after 3 months of usage.
If you are ok with overheating, apps slow performance, extremely low battery. Then this is the mobile for you.

Camera only one of the USP."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,S22 camera is mind-blowing..design so attractive..so thin ..look premium.. display outstanding.. everything is good but battery not good ...and mobile heating issue üòï cause snapdragon 8Gen 1 processor is heating processor ü§ßevery phone not just s22!
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Pretty good Phone for the price and camera is also exceptionally good. The phones is fast and responsive for daily use but have minor lag when opening some application also with terrible heating issues while recording or capturing pictures at higher resolution and fps. But the heating issue is bearable and doesn't become extreme one you put on a case. Also I'd recommend getting the screen protector from Samsung itself since the underscreen fingerprint sensor could sometimes fail to detect fingerprint while using other screen protectors for this device. The battery life could also be a bit pain if you are a heavy user. Overall very good product if you are looking for an flagship android within a budget.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"S22 is very nice selection I done this year.
Specially it's design, even it makes iPhone behind.
Camera is good. Battery is OK.
Else what I can say. You know better, it's Samsung flagship phone."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Pros - the camera is awesome and video quality is excellent, video portrait in 3x is better than iPhone, edge detection is superb... performance is outstanding.
