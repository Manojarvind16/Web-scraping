SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Camera and a performance Beast!
Been using it for 10 days now and here's the summary:-

PROS:
-Camera__Nightography is insanely good. Beats iPhone14 and other top flagship phones by far. Portraits are a bliss for the eyes, feels like shot from DSLR.
-Performance__Super smooth performance with 8 gen 1. Can handle any mobile games flawlessly. Played BGMI and Asphalt 9 and there are hardly any frame drops even after an hour.
-Display__Display is too good. Peak brightness is enough and works brilliantly even during noon. Bezels are so slim it feels like holding just the screen.
-Design__In hand feel is Premium. Thought the s22 would be smaller but it actually fits perfectly and probably better than the s22+. Back glass looks super Premium.

CONS
-Battey__It's a big setback for this flagship Beast. Lasts 24hrs only in standby or if you pass half the time not using the phone. Barely lasts 12 hrs with a little bit of camera and ~1hr of gaming. Reason for a less star
-Heating__Heats a lot while playing games or recording videos. Would suggest doing these without a back cover for better performance.

OVERALL it's a steal @39999 just for the camera and performance. I genuinely prefer only these 2 and it doesn't bother me to charge the phone a couple of times or carry a powerbank so the cons are fine by me. But if you want your phone to last for a day or prefer bigger screen/storage there are better options in this price range.

Hope this helps üòÉ"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Writing this review after a month usage. Bought it in BBD for 38k.
1) Display : top notch, touch is like butter smooth
2) Camera : In better lightimg conditions photos are exceptional while in low light it struggles a bit. Portrait mode is awesome.
3) Battery : i use to charge for 85% and it lasts for a day. Fast charge is superb. Frm 10 - 85% charge, it takes around 50mins. I DON'T FIND NY HEATING ISSUE."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,best in class
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Camera is too cool
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Everything is great except the battery , doesn't even last 12 hrs or even 8 hrs if used properly, have to charge multiple times ü•≤"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Pros:-
1)Size n Design
2)Camera Quality
3)Display
4)Processor
Cons:-
1) Battery life üòë

Day 1 to 3 Battery hardly lasts for 2hr Screen time. I was so afraid and also planned to return the product. But resolved in few steps.

STEP 1:- Use Wifi insted of mobile data.
STEP 2:- Use in Power Saving mode
STEP 3:- Dont use Super Fast charging, Use Fast Charging insted. (CAN change in settings)
Only for a week, then you can change the setting once the battery is set.
STEP 4:- USE only one physical sim(Can use e-sim secondary)....."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Camera is super good.... decent performance.... battery drains really fast and heating issue is still there but it has been resolved to some extent
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Amazing product under 40k , i like it , FANTASTIC performance, decent phone with great performance, looks,cameras etc."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Phone is very Handy and camera Quality is awesome and 16bit Raw click is make this phone killer in this price segment. Due havy processor some time it get heating Issue but it manageable. Over-all Phone performance of this phone is Excellent.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Product is good very handy good display but need to improve on battery as it does not last whole day
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,The only drawback is HEATING which causes rapid decrease in battery percentage and ANDROID 13 adds more jolt to it. Hope that company optimises this through a stable update. And for rest this the only thing i need to say (BEAST COMPACT FLAGSHIP)

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Premium one!
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"I'm a hard-core Android user.. and this phone proves to be excellent in performance. Feels very classy in hand and the size is just perfect for people like me looking for a pocket able phone.. feels just amazing in hand. But.. con: big weakness is the battery.. which lasts 'just about a day'.. at times makes you feel uncomfortable when by evening it drops to 25 odd percent ü§î
But overall.. an excellent phone"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,This is a great phone...
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Phone is brilliant, I like its camera very much, performance is great but sometimes heat very much, battery performance is very bad you'll only get 4.5 hours screen on time."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Awesome
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,All Good Good
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Camera - photos are excellent. videos are also good but not the best.

display - highest grade.

performace - top notch. No lag whatsoever.

battery - Oh well. Not good. But works for me as i am not a heavy user. 100 to 20% in 20hours of easy to medium usage of phone which includes some video calls, lots of calls, lots of messaging. some photography.

overall - A good phone for a person who just takes calls, reply to messages some social media and doesnt game that much."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Overall a great deal for moderate users!
Display and camera quality is just amazing.
Phone is small and handy and feels premium.
Only problem is battery as standby time can be less if heavy user."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Picture quality is good. But what disappointed me is the battery health of the phone which drains fast.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,It's truly a tiny beast. Awesome camera and display
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Best camera for photography , prosessing was awsome, slightly heat issue when using camera , hope it will fix soon"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Overall the performance of the mobile is excellent. Samsung Galaxy S22 is a compact high end device with every feature integrated inside it. I fell the draw back of the mobile is the battery. You have to charge your mobile two time in a day if you are using it excessively.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,I got the best phone in BBD sales and also I like him most because it has an awesome camera and performance is also superb. One disappointing thing is the battery if you use your phone continuously it takes two times a charge in a day. But overall the best phone I got
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"The Samsung S22 is a phone that has some great features, but also some significant drawbacks. One of the biggest issues with this phone is its battery life. The battery drains quickly, even with normal use, and it can be frustrating to constantly have to charge the phone throughout the day. This is definitely a disadvantage for users who are always on-the-go and need a phone that can keep up with their busy lifestyle.

However, the Samsung S22 also has some standout features that make it a worthwhile purchase for some users. The display on this phone is fantastic, with crisp and vibrant colors that really pop. Whether you're watching videos, browsing the internet, or playing games, the display is sure to impress.

Another area where the Samsung S22 excels is in its performance. The phone is equipped with a powerful Snapdragon processor that delivers fast and smooth performance for all your daily tasks. Whether you're multitasking between apps or running demanding games, the Samsung S22 can handle it all with ease.

Overall, the Samsung S22 is a phone that has its ups and downs. While the battery life can be frustrating, the display and performance are both excellent. If you prioritize a great display and fast performance over battery life, then the Samsung S22 may be the perfect phone for you."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Best camera phone in this price range,performance is also great but battery is very bad,display is very good,it's a great deal if you love photography."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Camera performance super videography super but battery life low over heating
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Ghaint Phone
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Before buying this product I have heard many times that this battery doesn't lasts long even a day but wanted to buy this phone at any cost because this one problem was not a deal breaker and I love Samsung phones especially their display design and camera. But believe me after buying this phone even though I got less screen time but after using 2 to 3 weeks the phone gets adapt to the usage and gets optimized and I have easily got about 4.5 to 5 hours easily and I am a moderate user casual games, video streaming, social media and lot of phone calls.
Don't revert your decision hearing from people about it's battery believe me it's worth it."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"This Phone is GEM but except battery. Battery is very very poor like 3-4 Hours screen time with medium heavy usage,
If samsung control the processor clock speed in low freq then phone is beast"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Delight to use. Feels premium I hand. Only negative side is battery back-up. Need to charge every day at 3pm if I start the day with 100% charge.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"The design and look are awesome,
Day mode camera üì∏ Good, but the the night mode camera üì∏ not Good. Performance Super, no lag, Battery üîã so poor, heating issue, when you are the 120hz refresh rate used, but you change refresh rate 60 hz then not any heating issue."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Writing this device review after 15 days of using,
I got this phone at 34k. This is a fully packed mobile with lots of good features and specs. Battery easily lasts for more than 5.5hrs (100% to 25-20%) in simple + moderate use (on 60hz) and also 25watt charging is superfast according to 3700 mah battery capacity. It tooks 50-60 minutes to get fully charged and in 20 minutes, it charges the device to 50% with original Samsung Charger. This phone targets simple user who are not always active on their mobile screen. Camera, Performance, Display, In-Hand feeling all are really premium. Please do update to the latest Android version for smooth experience and good battery life. During first 3-4 days, the UI will learn your usage pattern and then it will optimise the phone's battery according to your usage and i also don't feel any kind of over heating while testing it with heavy games and application, it only gets warm which is very common in every phone. If you're a heavy user or looking for good battery phone which can last upto or more than 6hrs, then go with OnePlus and IQOO. I was also looking for Nothing phone 2 but it is still a new brand so trust issues are obvious. I was looking for a handy and flat display phone with Clean UI and good features, This device really matched my requirements."

This phone is not for the addicts it is one of the best daily use phone if u don't play much games. (I can say this suits for one who isn't always on their screen )

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,Fantastic mobile but. Battery week
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,This was such a great buy and a great value for money phone currently.. If u can adjust with battery and little bit heating issues u can go for it.. I choose this phone becuase of its compact looks beezellees display and premium design.. But currently i recommend u must extend a little budget and go with s23.. there us not much difference in both this phone but s23 will provide a more years of updates and it doesn't have heating issue..
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"been using this phone for 7 days now, got this beauty for only 31k so will be keeping that in mind
if you are heavy user and use your phone for gaming and only like to charge your phone once a day, dont buy this.
if you can ignore that and and want to have a pho ne for content consumption. go for it
everything is top notch, the build quality, the camera, the UI, the processor, the size like everything is perfect
and for the price of 31k i can ignore the battery thing. i use this phone for music, videos and work and get around 6 hours for backup.
and the phone dont heat, it has not happened, i did play some heavy games just to check, no heating as of now."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"This is a amazing camera and performance,, and this design is so awesome but battery backup is weak but it's amazing üëç"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"The Samsung Galaxy S22 is a compact flagship phone with a beautiful design, great cameras, and fast software updates. However, its battery life is underwhelming, and it has high idle battery drain.

Pros:

Beautiful design
Great camera
Fast software updates
Compact size

Cons:

Bad battery life
High idle battery drain

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S22 is a great phone, but its battery life is a major drawback. If you're looking for a compact flagship phone with a great camera and fast software updates, the S22 is a good option, but be prepared to carry a charger with you.

Here are some additional thoughts on the S22's battery life:

The S22 has a relatively small battery, at 3,700mAh. This is less than the batteries in many other flagship phones.

The S22's battery life can be especially poor if you use it for demanding tasks, such as gaming or video streaming.

S22 has high idle battery drain, meaning that it loses battery even when you're not using it actively.

If you're considering buying an S22, it's important to be aware of its battery life limitations. If you're a heavy user, or if you need your phone to last all day on a single charge, you may want to consider a different phone.

As battery backup isn't an issue for me hence giving 4 stars."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Overall the phone is fabulous except for the battery.
Display is awesome as always stunning OLED display.
Camera is also great up to the mark
But when comes to battery device goes down ..
Observed heating issue while using camera.
Over all iam satisfied with the device .

And I was planning to give 5 star rating but due to 2 factors I I have rated the device 4 only
1. As already mentioned battery is too low compared with other phones in market .
2. In case of this full credit goes to Flipkart ...they are charging. 40 rupees for secure packing .but till now I couldn't find out what safety was there ... same old package of Flipkart with out any changes no any airbubles protection nothing just the paper box ..and we are paying extra rupees for this same packing.
@flipkart requesting your team to add any special secure package for fragile things and charge the money. Just for the old package please don't charge any extras.
If the secure package was ok then also I would have rated as 5."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"So anyone having second thoughts for this phone, trust me just buy this beautiful piece of art. The battery is good if you are a normal user, it charges fast so no issues but apart from battery bro everything is beautiful, its camera, its display, its sleek design every thing. Must buy"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Awesome mobile. Even in 2024. Camera is super awesome. It's so handy. Best Android phone.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Umm.. best phone but battry is backup is low.. but phone is premium and looking wise very good and handy feel. This phone camera is very best and 3x tele photo mode is DSLR level photo graphy..
Thank you..."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Nice phone u can buy it.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Very nice phone but battery and charging is very üòû üò•

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Loved it
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Great Camera with telephoto lens..

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Over all this is an amazing phone and 4.8 of 5 , dont compare the battery backup coz this is a handy one"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Camera performance is good
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"This phone is soo compact which is liked by mostly everyone. It's performance is very good ( having sanpdrogen 8 gen1). but it heat up a little bit which is not a major problem. Is is waterproof. It's camera is better then iphone 12, as I tested it or 13 as well. And it feels slightly smaller then iphone 12. It's display is just insane. BGMI runs in full setting no lagg even in rush . But you have to charge it frequently for heavy gaming . I would recommend it .........üòåüòå"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,It's awesome product justin case if you ignore battery uses it will be a good product for office purpose and professional uses
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Camara is osm but heating issue and battery's life is very low
My feedback phone is very osm and heandy phone"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"A tough competitor for iPhone 13
Awesome zoom 30x
Great portrait pics
Handy device
Good battery life
Fast processor
Worthy S series device"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"Very good Camera.
Battery life is poor, by end of day with normal usage it is almost dead. With battery less than 10% don't depend on phone for next day's morning alarm. Even with Wifi, Mobile network being off it dies down
Major issue that I have is poor face and fingerprint detection. Even with same facial exposure sometimes it gives error as Face not detected. Same with fingerprint too. Sometimes you need to press so hard multiple times. Real real issue at times of emergency. I love my iPhone 14 for the facial Recognition feature.
Performance otherwise is excellent, smooth typing, good display and overall with heavy duty Apps."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Excellent..best performance..best buy
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"Only Camera phone.

Performance not upto the mark, Ram management is not good. Battery life is bad. Hardly I get 4hrs of SOT from 85% to 5%.

If you just want a compact phone with good cameras then only I will suggest you to buy this otherwise skip"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"Battery is bad, except battery phone is overall good, but if you are a heavy user you need to charge your phone thrice a day...except battery photos are awesome, display quality is at his best, inland feel is fantastic.."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,What a beautiful phone....performed like a beast...camera quality awsome...just go for it without hesitation....
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Battery is fine, last upto 24-28 hrs with normal usage. 4/5
Dolby atmos sound quality is superb.5/5 Fingerprint sensor is not good -3/5
Camera and features 5/5"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"The good:
- SPOT ON size, weight and in hand feel (actually feels like a phone in hand, rather than a big brick)
- Outstanding build quality
- Aesthetic design that is just beautiful to look at, especially if you go for the matte black color
(Better than the latest S series and iPhones in my opinion)
- Impressive Camera quality (both for pictures and videos)
- Clean, smooth, vivid and high quality display as expected from Samsung
- Good call and speaker quality
- Received Android 14 updated with One UI 6.0 (6.1 expected soon)

The not so good:
- Upon heavy usage, heats up like a pan
- Battery life is a HUGE limitation, must carry a power bank or charger around when travelling

I'm able to live with the limitations as I like to keep my phone usage quite low, and I have access to charging sockets throughout the day."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Best mobile For camera But hit problem üòï and battery backup üòí
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Nice one
But battery back up is decent"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"How can you make a product soo good yet soo bad.
I am stunned at the level of incompetence that Samsung has done with the battery here.
I mean you would love the phone everything that it is capable of, the speed, the camera, the display (phenomenal) and then you see your battery dying 1% every 3 minutes in even in battery saver mode."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Awesome Camera
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Samsung s22 is the champ and maybe also called as android of iPhone. It literally seems to be powerhouse while during multitasking and also while gaming. It will only throttle when it gets hot. Camera is also good and gives good quality images and also night mode is good üëç. If you want a one hand compact phone and also want beast performance while doing gaming. Then you can go for this phone. Only con in this phone is the battery. It's 3700 and I need to charge twice a day as my usage. So buy before you do your research on this phone.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Terrific camera...
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Amazing product,value for money, Camera is awesome and delivered same dayüòçüòçüòç"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,The photographic performance decreased after updating
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"I bought this phone on BBD sale. It's working fine till now.
Pros:
1. Phone size is perfect.
2. Smooth performance .
3. Camera is good.

Cons:
1. Battery performance is not good for heavy users.
2. Heating issue is there.
3. Fingerprint sensor is a bit slow."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Looks, camera design very nice
Overall loves this phone"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Over all it is a amazing flagship phone but with little heat issue.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Im using this for past 4 months from oct 2023. Phone is smooth and nice..Everything is good but.. Im facing heat issue while taking photos and videos I don't know is this normal. Battery is draining fast as per the usage..Max 8hr screen time is for 100%...
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Everything in this mobile is as per flagship standard except battery, this phone has very poor battery life, one should carry a PowerBank if going out for a longer period of time. Display is just 1080p. Performance is good."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Best phone in the price , fast delivery by Flipkart.. Battery would have been better."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"This is the my opinion for s22 after 1 month of use.
For 39,999 I think it's best flagship with Lot of features and stable UI . But main problem of this device is the battery 3700 mAh battery is not enough for one full day use. Anyone who is comfortable with charging twice a day like me then you can go for this. And one this on 5G network it consumes more battery."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Before I proceed with the review, let me tell you that this is going to be my secondary device. My primary device is still an iPhone.
As a secondary device, this is an all-round good phone.

Here are some of my initial impressions-

1. Good display with adequate outdoor brightness.
2. Compact size- this is one of the best features of this phone.
3. Good set of cameras.
4. Some useful features like Samsung Pay, DeX mode comes handy at times.
5. Performance is good- no major lag while casually using the device.
6. Heating is there, but it's manageable.
7. Speakers are decent.
8. Fingerprint scanner is somewhat good. If you have really dry hands (which some of us have during winters), then fingerprint scanner becomes unreliable at times.
9. Battery is decent. If you casually use this device, then the device will last for a typical working day. If you're a medium or heavy user, then please be prepared to carry a power-bank with you.
10. Build quality is good.

To conclude, I would say, if you're getting this device under 40K, and you're in market for a compact device, then go for this one. Remember, this phone is not meant for heavy usage. And as a secondary device, this serves the purpose well."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Camera ,processor,look,everything is awesome
It only lags in battery backup. In starting getting only 3 hrs Screen on time."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"It's design is most attractive, very sharp display quality, camera is awesome for this price, it's a better decision to buy galaxy S 22 than buying other high end versions which are expensive. Feeling satisfied. I highly recommend it. But if you want a big size display like S 23 Ultra or 14 or 15 Pro Max iPhone, this is not the right one."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Nice Camara
Battery avg
Nice display"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Amazing phone
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Excellent Compact Premium Phone at this price.

Pros:
Good design and premium material feel
Smooth UI Thanks to 120 hz display
Great camera
Handy and better to use

Cons:
Poor Battery for this high end Snapdragon processor and overheating at times during Camera usage."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Really great device.
BUILD QUALITY is really awesome all metal frame, glass back, flat display, compact size, everything is great.
BATTERY is a bit disappointing but suits Samsung's Fame it hardly gives 3 hours of screen on time.
HEATING is also a point in the device, it starts heating just under small pressure."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Title: Excellent All-Round Performer!

Review:
Purchased the Samsung S22 during the Big Billion Sale at Rs.40,000, and I must say it's a fantastic device overall. The camera is truly awesome, capturing stunning moments with clarity. The 6-inch size strikes a perfect balance between being handy and providing an immersive viewing experience. The metal finishing adds a premium touch to the design. The mind-blowing Dolby Atmos experience delivers unparalleled sound clarity, making every audio moment a pleasure. The display is excellent, providing vibrant and crisp visuals. However, the only downside is the battery backup with 3700 mAh, which could be better. Despite this, it's a solid purchase for its features and the discounted price during the sale."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,good üëç
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,If you need specially a camera mobile then go for it for sure coz it's camera quality is better than i phone 15 or 15 plus coz my wife has 15 plus.....not suitable for heavy user..!!

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Product is very good i really love it when I grab the phone its feel great. I used many phone like realme , Blackberry, motrola, Micromax, oneplus, redmi, i phone and even samsung but when i used this I can't describe performance is very good the major issue that i found is that some heating problem while playing a game for a long time but performance of game is very good you didn't see any lag at all and one thing battery issues is also play a big role here battery backup is not good.. but it stand for a day but overall camera is soo much good...even i phone cannot be matched."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Product is too much good and performance,color,camera is outstanding..Thank you Flipkart.."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Fantastic Phone with a Few Quirks

I recently got my hands on the Samsung S22, and it's an awesome phone! The design is top-notch, and the compact size makes it incredibly handy. The display is stunning, providing an immersive experience.

While the battery backup is not the strongest, it's manageable for about two days. Initially, I faced some heating issues, which raised concerns. However, after two days, it normalized. I still notice a bit of heat during video and photo capture, but I assume it's within the normal range.

Despite these minor quirks, I love this phone! It's a great buy considering its overall performance and design."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Samsung never disappointed us. S series üôå üëåüèª
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,It's a good choice. I got in 40k and better than iphone
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"This is an almost perfect smartphone for anyone looking for a combination of good camera and good performance but, and it's a BIG 'BUT', the BATTERY!!!!!

Coming straight to the point, this phone has it all covered with good screen, great camera, great performance and OneUI is just cherry on top.

But to enjoy all these things you would need a great batter, at least a decent one! And this phone lacks that!

I have used this phone in almost every condition. Indoors, outdoors, while travelling or while working.

And everywhere I face the same issue! the battery just drains like anything!

If you properly use this phone then you will have to charge it every 3 to 4 hours depending on your usage.

Even at very light usage you will have to charge this phone at least twice to go through a working day!

Other than that, there's no area you will complain on! I love this device. Just hopped that the batter was better!"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,Mobile battery backup is very poor
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Best in camera, battery life average"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Great product
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"I got this S22 and my friend has S23 Ultra, to be honest S22's camera turned out to be better than S23 Ultra.
Amazing display adaptive brightness even in sunlight.
Everything is perfect except one thing which i would like to mention is that when we use camera for sometime the device is getting heated up and the battery drains like an iphone."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"The phone is awesome and very premium by looks. It's very impressive when you hold it in and a very satisfying grip. Battery back up is bit low but manageable if you are not a hard core user. Gets heat when camera is used for a longer time.

Camera and display are very good and captures very natural colors. Videos at uhd 60 are really awesome and gives a feeling of live video. Very handy and easy to use single handedly.

I'm using it since a month and very happy to get it at 40k. The UI got recently updated with great modifications in notification bar, camera, gallery and other features like movable lock screen clock and customised side panel.

Overall its a great phone foe the users who aren5 iphone fans and fans to use a premium phone under 50k..

Display is a top notch with excellent brightness level."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Best in class. Battery doesn't last for long time. But os is best in class.

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"It's very compact phone. I like compact phones. Appearance camera performance holding in hand all are good.
Only issue with it is battery. Battery drains very quickly even you don't use moderately also. When we keep it for 5g signal battery further drains. I am totally unsatisfied with only battery issue. Remaining everything is good. 4/5 star"

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Awesome. Love with Samsung ‚ù§Ô∏è
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Samsung just missed the opportunity of making the best phone.
This phone has everything we need except battery life.
This phone is having the best camera which can beat any smartphone of this price range, even the above ones too.
Size is compact and it is a premium device.
But the battery, battery is the most frustrating factor about this one.
It gets drained even if one is not using the phone.
One full charge with good usage will last max to max 6 hours.

If one can ignore the battery aspect, then this is the best phone.
For photographers, this is a treat."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Have been using this product for more than 3 months now. overall it's been a smooth journey excepts for few things which are listed hereafter-

Camera-
Great Camera quality, Selfie camera is even better than iPhone 15 pro. Auto focus works great. Zoom-in and out works super great.

Only drawback is that if you want to click yourself with a great background such as sunrise or other, it might skip the background.

Performance -
Great.

Battery -
Biggest con of this phone is battery which runs only for around 6-7 hours of usage and with camera which is essential on a trip will go down up to 4-5 hours. Had to carry a power Bank with it all the time."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Pros
* Impressive camera quality and vibrant display.
* Outstanding overall performance.
* Handy and user-friendly design.

Cons
* Inconveniently short battery life, requiring twice-a-day charging.

S23 mobile avareg performance all specs."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Mobile is very good build quality. Both front and rear Camera is awesome. Phone is very compact like as iPhone. Display is very good.
I found one drawback after 2 days use..battery backup is very poor. In normal use you need 2 time charge in 24 hrs. I think it Wil be increase after 5 to 6 month.
Who need compact flagship phone if you Ready for ignoring battery issue then you can choose this..."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Except Battery, everything is good."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"The Phone is superb
One thing is like about this product is size and over all features
Battery if you are regular user you need to charge twice a day....
Over all if you ask I would rate 7 out of 10"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"I bought this in 34000,used it and satisfied with its performance but battery is biggest drawback with it.

Otherwise overall it's very good phone."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Really nice and handy mobile love the camera and nice display
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,The phone overheats and discharges by evening with normal usage. This is probably because of the SD 8gen1. Other than that the phone is stunning. Performance is very smooth and fast.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,would have love to give 5 stars rating if only not for üîã
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Superb product, using alongside my iPhone 14, only con is the battery, it charges much faster than the iPhone and drains much faster than it too, else a very sober and good product"

Hope battery will stood it's ground in upcoming year"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Camera is just awesome and Optimization is perfect even low light , Battery is good for normal usage not for Gaming. Worst part is heating issue."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Flagship phone, but battery backup is very poor and phone has heating issue for its processor."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"I order bora purple and I'm pretty satisfied with its premium feel in hand, the only issue with S22 is its battery, although for decent usage it lasts throughout the day, but you need to charge at night, if not charged at night, battery loss is around 10%
Camera quality is way too good."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Let's not talk about other features..people wnt to know about battery.
So the battery of this phone is small (3700mah) because you can't put big battery in a compact design phone..if you want a big battery in this compact form factor phone, it's like you wanna drive a sports car with a Volvo truck fuel tank..this can't be happen bro..
Both things cannot be together..like mkbhd says it's an iPhone of android world.
And I'm happy to have it.üòä"

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Everything is good. Display so good. Camera good. Just one thing which needs to be good is battery. The battery backup is very bad. And there should be option to select the refresh rate to 120 or 90 or 60 instead of adaptive option

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Looking very nice, Today I got it .Thanks flipkart"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Overall good and worth of buying smartphone but the battery is little questionable.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"I have to say the battery criticism given was correct but after ONE UI 6.1 battery got much better giving me 8-9 hours with 2 game arcade match of pubg and a little bit of videography. But I have to say I bought this phone for russia travel to meet my friend, where atmospheric temperature was very cold giving little performance push. But nonetheless this is the best flagship for price performance ratio"

Fantastic Camera.

Got it for 39k Rs from BBD sale.

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Absolutely beautiful design that feels premium as well as comfortable to hold. Also the build quality is very good.
Cameras on are the another best feature of this phone.
Display on this device is probably the best display one can get in this segment.
Having used the phone for past 5 days, the battery life also doesn't seem to be a problem as I was able to get a full day's battery backup with a sort of casual usage. Also no issue of over heating as such during normal usage of the phone.

Conclusion : Highly recommend üëç"

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Very happy to get a android iphoneüòÑ
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,If you are getting this in very low price then go for it. Plz try to buy 256GB version cause camera clicks very high quality photo.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Good and handy
Works totally fine
Yes battery quite disappointed but good as per 3700mah
Camera quality is best"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Definitely a very good perfoming phone. One of the best looking and compact phone.
Camera is very good but images seem sharp to me personally. Also, color doesn't come out very natural if lighting is not very good. A pink colored shirt looks reddish pink (i think the image got saturated).
Battery is fine for a normal user like me.

I ordered the phone in white color and received the cable in black haha, that's the only complaint!"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Awesome üëå
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"I absolutely love this phone. I already have a Samsung S21 ultra and I loved how the One UI has improved a lot. I was using an Old Oneplus 6 as my work phone and it had started lagging for me so I upgraded to S22 and fell in love with it. The compact size is something which is making me prefer this phone over my S21 ultra. The performance is smooth and it is truly a flagship.

The only drawback as everyone has mentioned is the battery, but I am using this phone just for my official work so I haven't had much issue with it and also if it comes to it I don't mind charging it 2 times in a day if needed, as I already have my primary phone for my private usage when this one is on charge.

If somebody is looking to use this as a primary phone and is a heavy user then Battery is something which they'll have to take I to consideration, but if multiple charging is not and issue go for it blindly. I bought it during the BBD sale at 39k and I don't regret this purchase at all. I'm really happy with the purchase"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Display is very smooth and clear
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Liked the Product a lot. I heard about the battery drain but I didn't found as such. Easily getting 5 hours of SOT. Display is very good. You can rely on camera performance. I like the software it is really very good.

just a con is the small battery which does not last for a day if you are rapid user other than that a little much of heating while multi tasking for a long time

PS- remember to use a case it is so much slippery on hand due to mate glass back and the curved alumunium edges"

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Low battery life
Camera super"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Everything is good
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Camera quality is good üëç but it's heating a lot and
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Nice
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,Very low battery
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"I replaced my old Samsung S9 Plus with this. Very disappointed with battery life and heating problems. Battery lasts for less than a day with normal basic usage with calls, email checks and some financial transactions. Phone overheats especially when using Google maps. If you connect to car charger while using Google maps, it gives a pop up message about overheat after sometime and stops Google maps. I had called Samsung service and even visited service centre but they did basic checks and returned my phone saying they couldn't find any issues and washed off their hands. Service centre people even suggested to use original Samsung Charger but they don't sell car chargers and just gave random reason. Camera quality is bad especially when I used in auditorium event setups to capture performance. Both photos and videos came out bad and grainy. However, photos come out very good if you use in outside on normal day light. Some night shots also were good."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Battery and heat main problem
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Exalent in all but heating some times but it controls shortly
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,Overall a best product
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Mind blowing phone,i love it"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"My very first flagship phone and I have to say it's an all-rounder but the battery and heating issue disappointed me big time. The camera is good but the image processing could have been better. And to not include at least a charger for a phone of this price was a bummer. You need to charge it at least thrice a day if you're using Internet the whole day, heavy gaming can cause heating faster and the battery *surprise surprise* more than average. So you can't actually have a prolonged gaming session with it.
Other than these cons, the phone is beautiful, compact and easy to hold for small hands. The snapdragon processor makes the phone work fast. Hope I can use this phone for a while ü•π"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"Cons: battery draining and over heating issues, camera is average"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"Phone is excellent days and camera everything is good but....


battery is very bad üò°ü§¨ü§¨"
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"Review after 3 months of usage.
If you are ok with overheating, apps slow performance, extremely low battery. Then this is the mobile for you.

Camera only one of the USP."
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,S22 camera is mind-blowing..design so attractive..so thin ..look premium.. display outstanding.. everything is good but battery not good ...and mobile heating issue üòï cause snapdragon 8Gen 1 processor is heating processor ü§ßevery phone not just s22!
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,Pretty good Phone for the price and camera is also exceptionally good. The phones is fast and responsive for daily use but have minor lag when opening some application also with terrible heating issues while recording or capturing pictures at higher resolution and fps. But the heating issue is bearable and doesn't become extreme one you put on a case. Also I'd recommend getting the screen protector from Samsung itself since the underscreen fingerprint sensor could sometimes fail to detect fingerprint while using other screen protectors for this device. The battery life could also be a bit pain if you are a heavy user. Overall very good product if you are looking for an flagship android within a budget.
SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,4,"S22 is very nice selection I done this year.
Specially it's design, even it makes iPhone behind.
Camera is good. Battery is OK.
Else what I can say. You know better, it's Samsung flagship phone."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,3,"Dont ever think to buy this phone, worst battery life, it drain 1% of battery within 2 min.

SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 5G,5,"Except battery and phone getting warm while using for any apps for an extended period of time. It's the best device for the price.
